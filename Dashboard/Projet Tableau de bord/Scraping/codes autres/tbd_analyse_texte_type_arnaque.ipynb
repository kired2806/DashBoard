In particular, there is less understanding of why certain people/demographics are likely to respond to fraudulent communications. This systematic review will provide a timely synthesis of the leading psychologically based literature to establish the key theories and empirical research that promise to impact on anti-fraud policies and campaigns. Relevant databases and websites were searched using terms related to psychology and fraud victimisation. A total of 44 papers were extracted and 34 included in the final analysis. The studies range in their scope and methods; overall, three main factors were identified: message (n\\u2009=\\u20096), experiential (n\\u2009=\\u20097), and dispositional (n\\u2009=\\u200921), although there was some overlap between these (for example, mapping message factors onto the dispositional traits of the victim). Despite a growing body of research, the total number of studies able to identify specific psychological processes associated with increased susceptibility to online fraud victimisation was limited. Messages are targeted to appeal to specific psychological vulnerabilities, the most successful linking message with human factors, for example, time-limited communications designed to enact peripheral rather than central information processing.

These types of cybercrimes alter the volume and complexity of problems compared to how they previously manifested and require profound transformations of crime analysis methods to address them proactively. These developments face many difficulties, such as the quality of accessible data, the lack of existing analytical models and the need to increase police knowledge of fraud mechanisms within every level of organisations. We suggest methods to overcome these obstacles, which consist of implementing an approach integrating theories from various fields in criminology and forensic intelligence to examine the digital transformations of certain criminal processes. We take, as an example, how a generic script expressing the anatomy of an existing type of fraud can be used to interpret their new digital forms. This modelling activity both provides new insight into specific frauds and highlights relevant dimensions that are useful in orienting the development of crime analysis systems.', 'title': 'Orienting the Development of Crime Analysis Processes in Police Organisations Covering the Digital Transformations of Fraud Mechanisms'}\n",

The bulk of attention is given to fraud victimization, with consideration also given to parent abuse, partner violence, and patient abuse. A review of data from the Federal Trade Commission shows that reports of most types of fraud grew significantly in the first three months of 2020 in comparison to the same time period in 2019. Differences between fraud experiences based on age are considered. Older persons lost much more to fraud than younger persons, and far more in 2020 than 2019. In addition, they reported being targeted more often for certain types of cybercrime (i.e., tech support scams). While devastating to everyone, it is concluded that the coronavirus will potentially have a more significant impact on the financial health of older persons than younger persons. It is concluded that minimizing the consequences of all forms of crimes targeting older adults will be best achieved by using a public health approach.', 'title': 'Criminals Work from Home during Pandemics Too: a Public Health Approach to Respond to Fraud and Crimes against those 50 and above'}\n",

This chapter examines the threats that have been posted by cybercrime, which is different from the “traditional” organized crime activities. This chapter uses Taiwan (the official name is the Republic of China, R.O.C.) as a case study. Following globalization and technological development, Taiwan’s underworld went into a new stage of development, penetrating political, economic and other aspects in the society. Thus, many organized crime groups vigorously expand their organizations oversees into East and Southeast Asia. As a result, Taiwan exported many masterminds of telecommunication and internet fraud crime and those criminals form organized crime groups in the third countries. The whole region is affected by the telecommunication frauds conducted by transnational criminal groups that are in many cases headed by Taiwanese.

The use of fraudulent identity and travel documents has been linked to a broad spectrum of criminal activities, ranging from financial scams and trafficking in human beings to terrorism and beyond.

Since then, criminals have become more creative, adapting and evolving in response to technological advancements in document security. In this regard, despite the introduction of biometric documents, the promise of tamper-proof official documents remains a holy grail, and document fraud still has a future ahead in the twenty-first century. Based on scientific and law enforcement data and sources, this article presents the imaginative modus operandi used by defrauders to counterfeit and forge documents. Considering the point of view of criminologists, forensic scientists, law enforcement and forgers, this article provides insights and opinions about current trends and challenges as well as future prospects. Key issues are raised, such as the involvement of organised crime and criminal networks, as well as the use of the Internet to trade fraudulent identity and travel documents.

Lower grey matter volumes, particularly within right medial temporal regions, are associated with higher scam susceptibility; however, very little is known about white matter associates. We investigated associations between white matter integrity measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and scam susceptibility in 302 non-demented older adults (75% female; mean years: age\\u2009=\\u200981.3 + 7.5, education\\u2009=\\u200915.7 + 2.9). Participants completed comprehensive neuroimaging (including DTI, T1- and T2-weighted imaging), a self-report measure of scam susceptibility, and neuropsychological testing. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) investigated associations of DTI-derived measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), trace of the diffusion tensor, axial and radial diffusivity (separately) with scam susceptibility adjusting for age, sex, education, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH; total volume and voxelwise separately). Statistical significance was determined at p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, Family Wise Error corrected. TBSS revealed significant negative associations between FA in tracts connecting a number of right hemisphere white matter regions and scam susceptibility, particularly after additional adjustment for global cognitive functioning. The pathways implicated were mainly in right temporal-parietal and temporal-occipital regions. Association of trace, axial, and radial diffusivity with scam susceptibility were not significant in fully-adjusted models. Lower white matter integrity within right hemisphere tracts was associated with higher scam susceptibility independent of relevant confounds including global cognition. Thus, a right hemisphere brain network that includes key structures implicated in multi-sensory processing of immediate and future consequences may serve as a neurobiologic substrate of scam susceptibility in vulnerable older adults.', 'title': 'White matter correlates of scam susceptibility in community-dwelling older adults'}\n",

Unfortunately, this growth in popularity is not limited to regular customers: Organized crime targeting online shops has considerably evolved in the past years, causing significant financial losses to the merchants. As criminals often use similar strategies among different merchants, sharing information about fraud patterns could help mitigate the success of these malicious activities. In practice, however, the sharing of data is difficult, since shops are often competitors or have to follow strict privacy laws. In this paper, we propose a novel method for fraud detection that allows merchants to exchange information on recent fraud incidents without exposing customer data. To this end, our method pseudonymizes orders on the client-side before sending them to a central service for analysis. Although the service cannot access individual features of these orders, it is able to infer fraudulent patterns using machine learning techniques. We examine the capabilities of this approach and measure its impact on the overall detection performance on a dataset of more than 1.5 million orders from a large European online fashion retailer.', 'title': 'Privacy-Enhanced Fraud Detection with Bloom Filters'}\n",

Therefore the need to ensure secured transactions for credit-card owners when consuming their credit cards to make electronic payments for goods and services provided on the internet is a criterion. Data mining has popularly gained recognition in combating cyber credit-card fraud because of its effective artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and algorithms that can be implemented to detect or predict fraud through Knowledge Discovery from unusual patterns derived from gathered data. In this study, a system’s model for cyber credit card fraud detection is discussed and designed. This system implements the supervised anomaly detection algorithm of Data mining to detect fraud in a real time transaction on the internet, and thereby classifying the transaction as legitimate, suspicious fraud and illegitimate transaction. The anomaly detection algorithm is designed on the Neural Networks which implements the working principal of the human brain (as we humans learns from past experience and then make our present day decisions on what we have learned from our past experience).

Among others, botnets severely affect ad networks (ANs), as botnets are increasingly used for ad fraud. Thus, ANs have an economic incentive, but they are not in the best position to fight botnet ad fraud. Consequently, ANs might be willing to subsidize the ISPs to do so. We provide a game-theoretic model to study the strategic behavior of ISPs and ANs and we identify the conditions under which ANs are likely to solve the problem of botnet ad fraud by themselves and those under which the AN will subsidize the ISP to achieve this goal.

Traditional approaches to detect telecommunication frauds usually rely on constructing a blacklist of fraud telephone numbers. However, attackers can simply evade such detection by changing their numbers, which is very easy to achieve through VoIP (Voice over IP). To solve this problem, we detect telecommunication frauds from the contents of a call instead of simply through the caller’s telephone number. Particularly, we collect descriptions of telecommunication fraud from news reports and social media. We use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and to select the high-quality descriptions from the data collected previously to construct datasets. Then we leverage natural language processing to extract features from the textual data. After that, we build rules to identify similar contents within the same call for further telecommunication fraud detection. To achieve online detection of telecommunication frauds, we develop an Android application which can be installed on a customer’s smartphone. When an incoming fraud call is answered, the application can dynamically analyze the contents of the call in order to identify frauds. Our results show that we can protect customers effectively.', 'title': 'Detecting telecommunication fraud by understanding the contents of a call'}\n",

Fraudsters collaborate and share/sell information about successful incidents, providing a window of opportunity during which similar attempts may also succeed. The financial sector is attempting to combat fraud in a similar way, through the sharing of information about fraudulent incidents among themselves to help prevent or quickly close those windows of opportunity. To date, solutions have been based on proprietary tools and techniques, hampering the ability to share information quickly and effectively among organizations that may use disparate products and solutions. Standards work is now underway in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to standardize the information about fraudent financial transactions and standardize a format for the exchange of related information. Other industry initiatives have also been undertaken to try to move the sharing of information from its current state, with closed networks using proprietary solutions, to a more open standards, based environment. For example, the Open Fraud Intelligence Network (OFIN) is a recent initiative from Entrust that will provide a standards-based vendor-neutral network for the exchange of fraud data, tactics and behavior.

Our findings suggest that whilst most of the tweets from our sample concerned issues that were not specifically about crime, especially during the first stages of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in tweets about fraud, cybercrime and domestic abuse. There was also an increase in retweeting activity as opposed to the creation of original messages. Moreover, in terms of the impact of tweets, as measured by the rate at which they are retweeted, followers were more likely to ‘spread the word’ when the tweet was content-rich (discussed a crime specific matter and contained media), and account holders were themselves more active on Twitter. Considering the changing world we live in, criminal opportunity is likely to evolve. To help mitigate this, policy makers and researchers should consider more systematic approaches to developing social media communication strategies for the purpose of crime mitigation and reduction during disruption and change more generally.

Fake computer updates, which attempt to persuade people to download malicious software by mimicking trusted brands and/or instilling urgency, are one way in which fraudsters try to infiltrate systems. A recent study of young university students (M 18.52-years) found that when such pop-ups interrupt a demanding cognitive task, participants spent little time viewing them and were more likely to miss suspicious cues and accept these updates compared to when they were viewed without the pressure to resume a suspended task [1]. The aim of the current experiment was to test an older adult sample (N\\u2009=\\u200929, all >60 years) using the same paradigm. We predicted that they would be more susceptible to malevolent pop-ups [2]; trusting them more than younger adults (e.g., [3]), and would attempt to resume the interrupted task faster to limit forgetting of encoded items. Phase 1 involved serial recall memory trials interrupted by genuine, mimicked, and low authority pop-ups. During phase 2, participants rated messages with unlimited time and gave reasons for their decisions. It was found that more than 70% of mimicked and low authority pop-ups were accepted in Phase 1 vs ~80% genuine pop-ups (and these were all approximately 10% higher than [1]). This was likely due to a greater tendency to ignore or miss suspicious content when performing under pressure, despite spending longer with messages and reporting high awareness of scam techniques than younger adults. Older adult participants were more suspicious during Phase 2 performing comparably to the younger adults in [1]. Factors that may impact older adult decisions relating to fraudulent computer communications are discussed, as well as theoretical and practical implications.', 'title': 'Exploring Older Adult Susceptibility to Fraudulent Computer Pop-Up Interruptions'}\n",

See, for all, the work of Aurora Teixeira, Donald McCabe, Dan Ariely, Francesca Gino or Steven Levitt. More than an ethic crises, the explanation could arise not only of utility-maximization behaviours but also, in a competitive environment, from perverse incentives associated to bounded rationality and cognitive biases. Based in Harry Potter’s fiction, mainly spent in a school environment and transversal to most cultural and age strata, and in Behavioural Law and Economics insights, we will both look for illustrations and explanations for this phenomenon and for effective and efficient solutions to deal with it without imposing a typical paternalistic approach. Firstly, this task implies the identification of the costs and benefits behind the motivation of cheating and of the risk taken both in an individual and collective perspective. Secondly, it is necessary to recognize the biases behind the decision of cheating (after all agents are of flesh and bone, contextualized and with computational and motivational limitations), including an eventual distortive institutional framework. Inspired by Hogwarts, we will try to present some proposals for a correct and preventive architecture of choice and nudging behaviours to decrease academic fraud. Even though some may doubt its normative inferences, this approach has positive, normative and prescriptive potential, i.e. prevision, redirection of conducts and design of a legal framework to contradict systematic biases. Therefore, as institutions serve as behavioural anchors, the readjustment of a new choice architecture implies, surely, its re-appreciation (at least in relative terms) and a re-equation of values, mainly academic integrity.', 'title': 'Academic Fraud at Hogwarts'}\n",

Current anti-fraud solutions enable the detection of IRSF afterwards by detecting deviations in the overall caller’s expenses and block phone devices to prevent attack escalation. These solutions suffer from two main drawbacks: (i) they act only when financial damage is done and (ii) they offer no protection against future attacks.

Age-related changes in brain macrostructure may be associated with susceptibility to scams; however, this has yet to be explored. Based on previous work implicating frontal and temporal lobe functioning as important in decision making, we tested the hypothesis that susceptibility to scams is associated with smaller grey matter volume in frontal and temporal lobe regions in a large community-dwelling cohort of non-demented older adults. Participants (N = 327, mean age = 81.55, mean education = 15.30, 78.9 % female) completed a self-report measure used to assess susceptibility to scams and an MRI brain scan. Results indicated an inverse association between overall grey matter and susceptibility to scams in models adjusted for age, education, and sex; and in models further adjusted for cognitive function. No significant associations were observed for white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, or total brain volume. Models adjusted for age, education, and sex revealed seven clusters showing smaller grey matter in the right parahippocampal/hippocampal/fusiform, left middle temporal, left orbitofrontal, right ventromedial prefrontal, right middle temporal, right precuneus, and right dorsolateral prefrontal regions. In models further adjusted for cognitive function, results revealed three significant clusters showing smaller grey matter in the right parahippocampal/hippocampal/fusiform, right hippocampal, and right middle temporal regions. Lower grey matter concentration in specific brain regions may be associated with susceptibility to scams, even after adjusting for cognitive ability. Future research is needed to determine whether grey matter reductions in these regions may be a biomarker for susceptibility to scams in old age.', 'title': 'Grey matter correlates of susceptibility to scams in community-dwelling older adults'}\n",

We use a combination of survey results, an experiment, and structural equation modeling to empirically test our model. The theoretical insights demonstrate that psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism affect different parts of the unethical decision-making process. Narcissism motivates individuals to act unethically for their personal benefit and changes their perceptions of their abilities to successfully commit fraud. Machiavellianism motivates individuals not only to act unethically, but also alters perceptions about the opportunities that exist to deceive others.

The global impact of credit card fraud is alarming, millions of US dollars have been lost by many companies and individuals. Furthermore, cybercriminals are innovating sophisticated techniques on a regular basis, hence, there is an urgent task to develop improved and dynamic techniques capable of adapting to rapidly evolving fraudulent patterns. Achieving this task is very challenging, primarily due to the dynamic nature of fraud and also due to lack of dataset for researchers. This paper presents a review of improved credit card fraud detection techniques. Precisely, this paper focused on recent Machine Learning based and Nature Inspired based credit card fraud detection techniques proposed in literature. This paper provides a picture of recent trend in credit card fraud detection. Moreover, this review outlines some limitations and contributions of existing credit card fraud detection techniques, it also provides necessary background information for researchers in this domain.

Multiple trusted parties may be used for increased scalability. OTPs can be used regardless of a transaction’s purpose (e.g. user authentication or financial payment), associated credentials, and online or on-site nature; this makes CROO a universal scheme. OTPs are not sent in cleartext; they are used as keys to compute MACs of hashed transaction information, in a manner allowing OTP-verifying parties to confirm that given user credentials (i.e. OTP-keyed MACs) correspond to claimed hashed transaction details. Hashing transaction details increases user privacy. Each OTP is generated from a PIN-encrypted non-verifiable key; this makes users’ devices resilient to off-line PIN-guessing attacks.

These systems have been proved to be sensitive to fraud and have shown some shortcomings as a result of capturing opinions through numerical ratings. Thus, supported by recent work on the field, we tackle the problem of fraud in such systems by designing a mechanism based on pairwise comparisons, coupled with an incentive policy attempting to foster the collection of majority opinions over individual experiences. As a result, we propose a new mechanism called iPWRM (incentive-based PWRM), where users are persuaded to reply honestly to pairwise queries based on opinion polls. The idea is: (1) to give a positive reward when all users agree in their reviews; (2) to give a positive reward when a user agrees the majority’s choice; and finally, (3) to give a low incentive—possibly null—when user’s review does not match the majority. Therefore, it is able (1) to overcome the bias introduced into reputation rankings by fraud reviews in ORSs, as well as (2) to mitigate potential biased problems derived from the use of numerical ratings. We exhaustively test the performance of the mechanism by using two different well-known existing datasets Flixster and HetRec2011—real world datasets on movie reviews, aiming to test the performance of the mechanism as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of iPWRM when fraud comes into play.', 'title': 'Estimating global opinions by keeping users from fraud in online review systems'}\n",

To cope with such issues, it is useful to incorporate social network forensics (SNF) techniques for analyzing and surveying social interactions to detect, predict and prevent all forms of potential criminal activities. This chapter is organized in two main parts. First, SNs, their security and privacy issues are introduced and analyzed.

Traditional methods like manually detecting credit card frauds are feasible only for small datasets, but with the rise of big data, these methods are of no worth, hence has been proved as an unrealistic and time-consuming solution. Therefore, the finance industry is looking for help from data mining and machine learning methodologies in order to handle problems. But constructing rule for fraud detection algorithms is difficult because of imbalance nature of credit card dataset. Several challenges while mining credit card dataset with the experimental solution are presented through this paper. Undersampling and SMOTE oversampling techniques are applied to balance the real-time credit card transaction dataset, and then several supervised machine learning algorithms are compared to classify credit card frauds precisely. Credit card fraud detection model using logistic regression is pragmatic as the best classifier when compare to decision tree, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor. Confusion matrix and several other matrices are used during experiments to evaluate the performances of the credit card fraud detection model.', 'title': 'Adapting Machine Learning Techniques for Credit Card Fraud Detection'}\n",

Mortgage fraud has an adverse effect on individual homeowners, communities, and many indirect victims of the crime. While past research has focused on the personal motivating factors behind the commission of white-collar crime, this particular article reviews several facets of the crime itself and explores the potential neighbourhood risk factors that help attract the crime. From a national perspective, mortgage fraud seems to occur more frequently in neighbourhoods that have low socioeconomic indicators. These associations become even more pronounced when the degree of fraud occurrences within the community is factored in as a variable. Upon disaggregating the data according to region, the fraud indicator variables also display differing trend levels, perhaps indicating that as mortgage fraud practices begin to mature within an area, its community dynamics tend to change as well. The article concludes with recommendations for policymakers, community organizations, and law enforcement officials as to how to address mortgage fraud once it appears within a community, and also addresses future avenues of research for what is largely an untapped area of financial crime research.', 'title': 'Mortgage fraud: A risk factor analysis of affected communities'}\n",

For instance, many proponents of Internet voting argue that the introduction of an online voting channel would help to reverse the decline in turnout rates. Despite all the hypothetical benefits, however, an essential condition of voting is that the process rules out any possibility of fraud. Yet, as this chapter shows, it is questionable whether this prerequisite can actually be fulfilled by Internet voting due to security concerns. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, an investigation of e-voting requires a comprehensive approach that considers technical, legal, social and political aspects. Chapter  4 of this book tackles this challenge and is structured in two main sections: First, e-voting is approached from a theoretical perspective and the legal, technical, political and social issues that should be considered are presented. Second, an analytical framework comprising the five dimensions of history and background, motivation, legal context, organizational context and socio-political context is applied to in-depth case studies of Estonia, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. These case studies provide empirical evidence and the subsequent discussion allows a comparative and contextualised investigation of Internet voting and conclusions to be drawn with reference to the European perspective.', 'title': 'Electronic, Internet-Based Voting'}\n",

This scenario continues to be increasingly popular. We will illustrate it with a case study for an airline. As non-cash payments increase with our mobile life-style, so does the use of credit card payments over the Internet. Such use is referred to as CNP (Card Not Present), since the Merchant accepting the card has no contact with the cardholder except for the electronic transaction that is carried out. As there are many parties involved (merchant, service provider for IT services and website, payment providers, acquiring and issuing banks, switch, etc), determining liability in case of fraud is often not trivial. We will describe a real-world case, where the merchant experienced a fraud rate of more than 4% on his Internet payments. We will discuss the technical and legal safeguards that were implemented to fight the various frauds that were taking place. These safeguards concentrated on the implementation of 3D Secure for the CNP transactions, legal action, and an improvement of logical access controls for the airline reservation platform.', 'title': 'Fighting CNP fraud – a Case Study'}\n",

Secondly, to improve the accuracy of the predictive model, the FP-growth algorithm was adopted. The similarity identification of the correlation analysis was applied to further amend the warning score of the model.

This opaque state of affairs has been exacerbated by the relative lack of clear evidence attesting to and supporting either scenario.

By contrast, the geographies of licit, legal industries have produced multiple traditions of empirically rich, theoretically diverse accounts. Our understandings of the spatialities of illicit and illegal ‘industries’ derive from a different set of intellectual traditions for whom space is a less explicit, central concern. This paper aims to advance our understanding of the geographies of illegal economic activities by exploring the spatialities of one illegal industry, cybercrime (online for-profit fraud), through the lens of economic geography. It considers the spaces within which cybercrime is embedded, exploring it as the product of factors operating at multiple scales. It reviews cybercrime scholarship focused, variously, at the local, national and transnational scales and examines factors salient to the production of cybercrime through case studies at these scales. It examines national level drivers of cybercrime, local cybercrime agglomerations in Europe and transnational asymmetries, connections and opacities and the production of cybercrime. In each case, it reflects upon the potentials for the development of more spatially informed readings of cybercrime specifically, and illegal economic activities more generally, and considers how this might be mobilised to inform anti-cybercrime policy.

There are numerous theoretical approaches that attempt to explain how and why fraudulent acts occur, drawing on the fields of sociology, organisational, management and economic literature, but there is limited empirical evidence published in accounting literature. This qualitative inductive study analyses perceptions and experiences of forensic accountants to gain insights into individual fraud and co-offending in order to determine whether the conceptual framework developed from literature accurately depicts the causes of fraud committed by individuals and groups in the twenty-first century. Findings from the study both support and extend the conceptual framework, demonstrating that strain and anomie can result in fraud, that deviant sub-groups recruit and coerce members by providing relief from strain, and that inadequate corporate governance mechanisms both contribute to fraud occurring, and provide the opportunity for fraudulent activities to be executed and often remain undetected.

Thus, fraud is inevitable in the online financial market. Fraudulent texts are not strictly equivalent to low-quality campaigns, but fraudulent content can jeopardize users’ perceptions of project quality. Thus, the fraudulent text has great drawbacks for the development of crowdfunding model, leading investors lose confidence in this newborn financing model. Through text mining, 4 indicators are adopted to measure the linguistic feature related to fraud. And 126,593 campaigns from Kickstarter is employed to estimate the impact of linguistic feature related to fraud on the fundraising outcomes. Multi text levels are selected as the study objects include abstract, detailed description and the reward narratives. The results show that in general, lower linguistic feature related to fraud attracts the investors to contribute more money, the predictive model also validates this conclusion. However, some fraud indicators have no significant negative impacts on financing, or even show positive influences. Moreover, the detailed delivery terms in the reward text, the higher ratio of successful funding.

It is impractical to present an entire series of transactions to a fraud detection system, partly because of the very high dimensionality of such data but also because of the heterogeneity of the transactions. Hence, a framework for transaction aggregation is considered and its effectiveness is evaluated against transaction-level detection, using a variety of classification methods and a realistic cost-based performance measure. These methods are applied in two case studies using real data. Transaction aggregation is found to be advantageous in many but not all circumstances. Also, the length of the aggregation period has a large impact upon performance. Aggregation seems particularly effective when a random forest is used for classification. Moreover, random forests were found to perform better than other classification methods, including SVMs, logistic regression and KNN. Aggregation also has the advantage of not requiring precisely labeled data and may be more robust to the effects of population drift.', 'title': 'Transaction aggregation as a strategy for credit card fraud detection'}\n",

The main purpose of this chapter is to show that, in the period 1990–2015, there were a wider set of activities that are associated with scrutiny. Before turning to this main topic, the chapter examines the decade prior to the creation of the public Internet in the early 1990s and shows how urban legends were both spread and studies in pre-Internet technologies such as fax, bulletin boards, and proprietary online service providers such as America OnLine and Prodigy. The chapter then turns to the creation – beginning in the 1980s – of a new academic sub-discipline, the study of contemporary legends, primarily out of the disciplines of folklore studies and sociology. The focus is on one particular organization, the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research. The next section focuses on organizations such as Hoaxbusters, Scambusters, and VMyths, which were created as a public service to help individuals and organizations avoid computer viruses, chair letters, and Internet hoaxes through the use of appropriate scrutiny. The following section discusses entertainment. There are two types of entertainment considered here: one type are truth-or-fiction television shows such as Mythbusters and Unsolved Mysteries, which tell a narrative and then ask the audience to determine whether it is true or fake. The films, such as Candyman, and I Know What You Did Last Summer, either provided a full-length account of a single urban legend or offered up multiple urban legends in the same movie. The chapter concludes by pulling together these disparate events into a single coherent narrative involving scrutiny.', 'title': 'Debunking as Hobby, Entertainment, Scholarly Pursuit, and Public Service'}\n",

Credit card transactions are increasing faster because of the advancement in internet technology which leads to high dependence over internet. With the up-gradation of technology and increase in usage of credit cards, fraud rates become challenge for economy. With inclusion of new security features in credit card transactions the fraudsters are also developing new patterns or loopholes to chase the transactions. As a result of which behavior of frauds and normal transactions change constantly. Also the problem with the credit card data is that it is highly skewed which leads to inefficient prediction of fraudulent transactions. In order to achieve the better result, imbalanced or skewed data is pre-processed with the re-sampling (over-sampling or under sampling) technique for better results. The three different proportions of datasets were used in this study and random under-sampling technique was used for skewed dataset. This work uses the three machine learning algorithms namely: logistic regression, Naïve Bayes and K-nearest neighbour. The performance of these algorithms is recorded with their comparative analysis. The work is implemented in python and the performance of the algorithms is measured based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-measure and area under curve. On the basis these measurements logistic regression based model for prediction of fraudulent was found to be a better in comparison to other prediction models developed from Naïve Bayes and K-nearest neighbour. Better results are also seen by applying under sampling techniques over the data before developing the prediction model.', 'title': 'Comparison and analysis of logistic regression, Naïve Bayes and KNN machine learning algorithms for credit card fraud detection'}\n",

Paul Schwartz captures the intricate connection between the service administration and its need for personal information. As Schwartz writes, “[t]he state gathers information because distribution of social services is impossible without detailed information on the citizen as client, customer, or simply person to be controlled.” Moreover, the identification infrastructure established by the state also becomes the framework used in, for example, the financial services sectors. This makes the identification infrastructure important for both the public and the private sector. This chapter provides an overview of the main components of the identification infrastructure in both the United States and the Netherlands. The main components include identification information, ‘identification’ numbers, identification documents, and instruments used for electronic identification or authentication.', 'title': 'State as Provider'}\n",

Data imbalance also poses a huge challenge in the fraud detection process. The efficiency of the current fraud detection system (FDS) is in question only because they detect the fraudulent activity after the suspicious transaction is done. This paper proposes an intelligent two-level credit card fraud detection model from highly imbalanced datasets, relying on the semantic fusion of k-means and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) to enhance the classification accuracy and speed up detection convergence. ABC as a second classification level performs a kind of neighborhood search combined with the global search to handle the inability the k-means classifier to discover the real cluster if the same data is inputted in a different order it may produce different cluster. Besides, the k-means classifier may be surrounded by the local optimum as it is sensitive to the initial condition. The advised system filters the dataset’ features using a built-in rule engine to analyze whether the transaction is genuine or fraudulent based on many customer behavior (profile) parameters such geographical locations, usage frequency, and book balance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model can enhance the classification accuracy against the risk coming from suspicious transactions, and gives higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.', 'title': 'An intelligent credit card fraud detection approach based on semantic fusion of two classifiers'}\n",

(2) Compared with mass media, Internet media are characterized by digitalization, multi-media, hypertext and strong interaction. They have experienced three stages, namely, Internet media 1.0, Internet media 2.0 and next-generation Internet media, developing from one-way communication in the direction of interaction, diversified ecosystems and smart media. (3) By product or service type, Internet media can be categorized into new media, social media, search engines, knowledge platforms and audio-visual media. North America and Europe have more media discourse power and technical advantages, with their products available worldwide; and Asia, Latin America and Africa have local products and services with great potential, with room for improvement. (4) Internet media are channels for Internet users to obtain news and information. Comprehensive portals and aggregated news websites enjoy wide coverage. For example, the number of monthly accesses to Google News is 499.2 million. Traditional news media in major countries maintain strong momentum. The number of monthly accesses to the website of New York Times has reached 388.1 million. Europe, North America, China, Japan, Republic of Korea and Australia are witnessing digital transformation and upgrading of their traditional media and the revolution of their media industry. Africa and Latin America are weak in Internet news media, but some countries there with good Internet infrastructure have their local influential news media. (5) Social media are one of the most popular types of Internet media, including the social network, instant messaging (IM) and online forum (BBS), with the number of their users and their growth rate and penetration rate on the leading list of the world. By the second quarter of 2017, the number of active users of social media in the world had amounted to 3.028 billion, accounting for 79.29% of the total number of the world’s Internet users, but there exists imbalance in the development between regions. The penetration rate in Africa is only 14%, much lower than that in other regions. Social media have increasingly comprehensive functions. News feeds, payment transaction and live video have been added into social media and the mobile terminal has become an important area. (6) Google is the leader on the search engine market. By July 2017, its market share had remained 86.83% of the global total, and it had over 4.5 billion active users, as the leading search engine in most countries of Asia, Europe, Africa and Americas, but not in some non-English speaking countries, such as Russia, China, Republic of Korea and Japan. (7) Internet media of knowledge platforms include online encyclopedia and online Q&A. Wikipedia enjoys over 15 billion accesses every month. Knowledge platforms started early and have witnessed rapid development in North America, Europe and Asia, but started late in Africa and Latin America, where there are few localized knowledge platforms. (8) Audio-visual media take the lead in all Internet media in terms of traffic. It is estimated that their traffic will account for 76% of the total traffic of Internet media in 2018. YouTube has 1.5 billion active users every month. Audio-visual media will become an important growth point of the global entertainment and media industry, and tend to generate and deliver their content by themselves. They are divided into short video, live streaming and bullet screen to meet the demand of different groups of people for entertainment. The products of the United State enjoy the fastest development while those in other regions can meet their local cultural demand. Africa and Latin America have great potential demand, with South Africa and Brazil witnessing the greatest. (9) Forms of Internet media are undergoing profound changes. Traditional media are transforming into new media, with their delivery channels expanding to social platforms. News generation flows represented by “Central Kitchen” witness constant innovation and an obvious trend of paid subscription. Internet media embody open scenario communication, participation and feedback communication, layer communication, and social interaction communication. Internet media are becoming diversified, personalized, professionalized and data-oriented. (10) The necessity and importance of Internet content governance have become the consensus of governments, businesses, trade associations, media and the public, harmful information supervision being the core. The focus of governance is on information threatening national security, information of pornography and violence, information violating privacy and online rumors. In recent years, to curb the spread of terrorism online has been another focus. Legislative and administrative supervision has been combined with civil self-discipline, self-governance of media platforms and special actions. Varieties of technical means have been adopted for comprehensive governance. With the deep combination of advanced technologies like AI, VR and intelligent algorithm with media development, news content generation and information communication will be more diversified, personalized and target-oriented. To sum up, the Internet is a big social information platform, on which billions of Internet users obtain and exchange information. Internet media are the most common Internet application and service type and an important tool of obtaining information, acquiring knowledge, socializing and enjoying entertainment and leisure time. They have changed the pattern of mass communication, and they are influencing and reshaping production and social life. They can also reshape Internet users’ knowledge acquirement ways, thinking and values. They are carriers spreading positive energy and excellent cultures, playing an important role in enriching the Internet users’ cultural life and facilitating cultural prosperity and civilization progress.', 'title': 'Development of the World Internet Media'}\n",

Fine-tuning a new classifier could mean that, at the extreme, this new classifier will try to replicate the decision heuristics of the ground model. However, few new insights can be expected from a model that tries to merely emulate another one. Here, we study this problem in the context of click fraud prediction from highly skewed data that were automatically labeled by a proprietary detection algorithm. We propose a new approach to generate click profiles for publishers of online advertisements. In a blinded test, our ensemble of random forests achieved an average precision of only 36.2 %, meaning that our predictions do not agree very well with those of the ground model. We tried to elucidate this discrepancy and made several interesting observations. Our results suggest that supervised learning from automatically labeled data should be complemented by an interpretation of conflicting predictions between the new classifier and the ground model.

In such cases, the total weight of the drugs seized, the amount of monetary loss caused to the victim, or the market value of all items seized acts as a proxy for the severity of the crime. Often, however, the quantities that need to be determined are, for one reason or another, difficult to obtain. Therefore, in practice a statistical sampling and inference approach to estimating the appropriate quantity is used.

Such protection can come about through various means. The diversity of means is in part a reflection of the variety of threats that people face in contemporary society. Simultaneously, such diversity is also a manifestation of the multi-faceted nature of the state, even in its function as protector of the people. For financial identity theft, this diversity is apparent, especially since identity theft is a versatile problem which implicates many different segments of the state. Throughout the literature on identity theft, nevertheless, certain aspects consistently return. Several sources discuss the legislative developments in the criminal law arena, whereas others place an emphasis on data protection mechanisms in connection with identity theft.

A trust violation event could be a fraud or inappropriate use of funds either in one’s own charity organization, or it could be a similar event in another charity organization operating in the same sector. Unfortunately, fraud is not uncommon, and Wolverton (2003) reported that charity employees stole or misappropriated around $1.28 billion from 152 organizations over a 7 year period. Several authors have noted how fraud can heavily impact on the publics’ trust in non-profit organizations (e.g., Holtfreter 2008; Wilhelm 2006; Zack 2003). If a trust violation event becomes public knowledge, and they often do, they are likely to have a wide spread negative impact on donor trust. In this chapter it is argued that trust violation events require a charity to engage in additional information delivery (communication) activities, and having a clear plan for how trust violation events might be dealt with may help reduce their impact on fundraising efforts. This chapter also discusses research which has examined the media’s reporting of charity activities. This is followed by a description of how donors might process negative information about a charity. Finally, strategies which a charity might adopt to minimize the impact of a trust violation event on donor’s trust are discussed.', 'title': 'Dealing with Trust Violation Events'}\n",

With this regard, this research proposes a fraudulent website detection model based on sentiment analysis of the textual contents of a given website, natural language processing and supervised machine learning techniques. The proposed model consists of four primary phases which are data acquisition phase, preprocessing phase, feature extraction phase and classification phase. Crawler is used to obtained data from Internet and data was cleaned to remove non-discriminative noises and reshape into desired format. Later, meaningful and discriminative patterns are extracted. Finally classification phase consists of supervised machine learning techniques to construct the fraudulent website detection model. This research employs 10-fold stratified cross validation technique in order to validate the performance of the proposed model.

The limitations of survey research are well-known and exist in part because there are no positive or negative consequences to responses provided by survey participants. Such limitations are the motivation for this work. Experimental economics is widely accepted by economists and others as an investigative technique that can provide measures of economic choice-making that are substantially more accurate than those provided by surveys. This paper describes our efforts at applying the techniques of experimental economics to provide a foundation for (a) estimating the values that consumers place on privacy and various forms of security (encryption, HIPAA, etc.) and for (b) quantifying user responses to changes in the Internet environment. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of individual decision-making in the context of benefits and costs of making private information available to Internet sites. Preliminary results from a series of pilot studies are consistent with optimizing behaviors, indicating that continued application of experimental economics techniques in the quantification of Internet user actions in privacy/security space will be illuminating. Our results show that Internet users place great value on security measures, both regulatory and technical, that make identity theft much less likely. Our Web-based experiments indicate that privacy- and security- enhancing protections are likely to be subject to moral hazard responses, as participants in our online experiments became more aggressive in their Internet usage with greater protection in place.', 'title': 'An experimental economics approach toward quantifying online privacy choices'}\n",

Aarons was one of the most prolific writers in the genre, turning out more than 40 novels about CIA agent Sam DURELL as well as another two hundred stories and novelettes. Aarons was born in Philadelphia and worked as a newspaperman and in a series of odd jobs. His schooling was interrupted by World War II, in which he served in the Coast Guard, and he received his degree from Columbia University after the war. Although he had published his first mystery novel in 1938, Death in the Lighthouse, it was in the fifties that he began to turn out books at a great rate. He wrote under the pseudonyms of Edward Ronns and Paul Ayres as well as under his own name. Aarons’s work stresses action, adventure, and exoticism. Many of the Durell novels were named for the dangerous ingenues the agent was “assigned” to and usually slept with. Among his non-series novels is The Catspaw Ordeal (1950), a tale of espionage and betrayal set on the Connecticut coast. Many of his books have heroes defeating the diabolical forces of communism and foreigners, and the black-and-white attitude to U.S. Cold War foreign policy and hawkishness of the books is somewhat distasteful; however, Aarons’s failure to create believable characters and the lack of modulation in his stories are bigger problems.', 'title': 'Encyclopedia A–Z'}\n",

It appears that a major shift in enforcement practices was adopted by Centrelink and the public prosecutor, in part as a result of a legal case reducing customer liability for non-reporting of changes in their circumstances. Centrelink also adopted a new two-pronged strategy: focusing investigations and prosecutions on more serious cases, while also initiating an ‘early contact’ system to communicate more effectively with customers about their reporting obligations to prevent error and debt.

Fraud users often exploit the vulnerability of payment platforms and the carelessness of users to defraud money, steal passwords, do money laundering, etc., which causes enormous losses to digital payment platforms and users. There are many challenges for fraud detection in practice. Traditional fraud detection methods require a large-scale manually labeled dataset, which is hard to obtain in reality. Manually labeled data cost tremendous human efforts. In our work, we propose a semi-supervised learning detection model, FraudJudger, to analyze user behaviors on digital payment platforms and detect fraud users with fewer labeled data in training. FraudJudger can learn the latent representations of users from raw data with the help of Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE). Compared with other state-of-the-art fraud detection methods, FraudJudger can achieve better detection performance with only 10% labeled data. Besides, we deploy FraudJudger on a real-world financial platform, and the experiment results show that our model can well generalize to other fraud detection contexts.', 'title': 'FraudJudger: Fraud Detection on Digital Payment Platforms with Fewer Labels'}\n",

The policing of crimes of deception presents special—though not unique—problems because of (a) the social status of some suspects and (b) the relative inaccessibility of most offenses to routine observation and to normal police informant development strategies. This varies over time and place. To the extent that people conventionally defined as “organized criminals” become involved in frauds of various types and in laundering the proceeds of these and other crimes, routine police styles of dealing with racketeering are more likely to pick up frauds earlier. Likewise, the same need of the internet telemarketer to communicate with unknown potential victims also renders them vulnerable to police and regulator surveillance and—perhaps when law-enforcement is motivated, resourced, and provided with a legal mandate to do so—intervention. However, policing frauds and other financial crimes creates particular financial and institutional difficulties because of the regularity with which such investigations cross jurisdictions, even at a fairly modest level of victimization. As the comments above imply, the policing of financial crimes overlaps organized crime and white-collar crime (as defined, however vaguely, in police practices). It may be helpful to outline a typology of such crimes, as it would be a mistake to think that all have similar policing styles: for a more developed analysis, see Levi and Pithouse.1', 'title': 'Policing Financial Crimes'}\n",

In this paper, we examine the operations of three large-scale fake AV businesses, lasting from three months to more than two years. More precisely, we present the results of our analysis on a trove of data obtained from several backend servers that the cybercriminals used to drive their scam operations. Our investigations reveal that these three fake AV businesses had earned a combined revenue of more than $130 million dollars. A particular focus of our analysis is on the financial and economic aspects of the scam, which involves legitimate credit card networks as well as more dubious payment processors. In particular, we present an economic model that demonstrates that fake AV companies are actively monitoring the refunds (chargebacks) that customers demand from their credit card providers. When the number of chargebacks increases in a short interval, the fake AV companies react to customer complaints by granting more refunds. This lowers the rate of chargebacks and ensures that a fake AV company can stay in business for a longer period of time.9pc]First author has been considered as the corresponding author. Please check. However, this behavior also leads to unusual patterns in chargebacks, which can potentially be leveraged by vigilant payment processors and credit card companies to identify and ban fraudulent firms.', 'title': 'The Underground Economy of Fake Antivirus Software'}\n",

Digital technologies are viewed as a framework to improve care of older adults with bipolar disorder. This analysis quantifies Internet use by older adults with bipolar disorder as part of a larger survey project about information seeking.MethodsA paper-based survey about information seeking by patients with bipolar disorder was developed and translated into 12 languages. The survey was anonymous and completed between March 2014 and January 2016 by 1222 patients in 17 countries. All patients were diagnosed by a psychiatrist. General estimating equations were used to account for correlated data.ResultsOverall, 47% of older adults (age 60 years or older) used the Internet versus 87% of younger adults (less than 60 years). More education and having symptoms that interfered with regular activities increased the odds of using the Internet, while being age 60 years or older decreased the odds. Data from 187 older adults and 1021 younger adults were included in the analysis excluding missing values.ConclusionsOlder adults with bipolar disorder use the Internet much less frequently than younger adults. Many older adults do not use the Internet, and technology tools are suitable for some but not all older adults. As more health services are only available online, and more digital tools are developed, there is concern about growing health disparities based on age. Mental health experts should participate in determining the appropriate role for digital tools for older adults with bipolar disorder.', 'title': 'Internet use by older adults with bipolar disorder: international survey results'}\n",

Habbo Hotel, as a site of media convergence, incorporates social networking and digital gaming functionality. Our research highlights the ethical problems such a dual classification of technology may bring. We focus upon a particular set of activities undertaken within and facilitated by the space—scamming. Scammers dupe members with respect to their ‘Furni’, virtual objects that have online and offline economic value. Through our analysis we show that sometimes, online activities are bracketed off from those defined as offline and that this can be related to how the technology is classified by members—as a social networking site and/or a digital game. In turn, this may affect members’ beliefs about rights and wrongs. We conclude that given increasing media convergence, the way forward is to continue the project of educating people regarding the difficulties of determining rights and wrongs, and how rights and wrongs may be acted out with respect to new technologies of play online and offline.', 'title': 'Social networking and digital gaming media convergence: Classification and its consequences for appropriation'}\n",

Detecting frauds conducted by swindlers is a challenging issue. We propose an architecture to catch swindlers. It consists of four components: profile-based anomaly detector, state transition analysis, deceiving intention predictor, and decision-making component. Profile-based anomaly detector outputs fraud confidence indicating the possibility of fraud when there is a sharp deviation from usual patterns. State transition analysis provides state description to users when an activity results in entering a dangerous state leading to fraud. Deceiving intention predictor discovers malicious intentions. Three types of deceiving intentions, namely uncovered deceiving intention, trapping intention, and illusive intention, are defined. A deceiving intention prediction algorithm is developed. A user-configurable risk evaluation function is used for decision making.

This article provides an accurate description of how actors involved in drug trafficking behave in cyberspace and highlights how not only has the Internet opened the way for new criminal actors, but it also has re-configured relations among suppliers, intermediaries, and buyers. The conclusions suggest new directions for research and possibilities for a proactive law-enforcement approach.', 'title': 'Internet-mediated drug trafficking: towards a better understanding of new criminal dynamics'}\n",

From the methodological perspective, each section opens with a specific question and develops by trying to find a suitable answer. The paper starts by analysing what impact new technologies have on society and crime. It continues by examining how criminal patterns are changing (How does ICT facilitate the commission of new and traditional crimes?) and who these criminals are (Are criminals really going cyber?). It ends by focusing on the other side, on how crime is prevented and combated (How are technologies reshaping the approach and the fight against crime at legal, law enforcement and scientific levels?). The analysis and the results achieved show that new technologies are valuable means in the hand of both criminals and institutions involved in the fight against crime. There is thus an urgent need to improve knowledge about the phenomena, and develop new paradigms and theories together with best practices.', 'title': 'The Fox and the Hunters: How IC Technologies Change the Crime Race'}\n",

Thus, an effective Fraud Detection System (FDS) is important to minimize the loss for banks and cardholders. Based on our analysis, the credit card transaction dataset is very skewed, there are much fewer samples of frauds than legitimate transactions. Furthermore, due to the data security and privacy, different banks are usually not allowed to share their transaction datasets. These problems make FDS difficult to learn the patterns of frauds and also difficult to detect them. In this paper, we propose a framework to train a fraud detection model using behavior features with federated learning, we term this detection framework FFD (Federated learning for Fraud Detection). Different from the traditional FDS trained with data centralized in the cloud, FFD enables banks to learn fraud detection model with the training data distributed on their own local database. Then, a shared FDS is constructed by aggregating locally-computed updates of fraud detection model. Banks can collectively reap the benefits of shared model without sharing the dataset and protect the sensitive information of cardholders. Furthermore, an oversampling approach is combined to balance the skewed dataset. We evaluate the performance of our credit card FDS with FFD framework on a large scale dataset of real-world credit card transactions. Experimental results show that the federated learning based FDS achieves an average of test AUC to 95.5%, which is about 10% higher than traditional FDS.', 'title': 'FFD: A Federated Learning Based Method for Credit Card Fraud Detection'}\n",

In this paper, we consider one potential explanation for the persistence of the expectation gap: the role of media bias in shaping public opinion and views. We analyze press articles covering 40 U.S. corporate fraud cases discovered between 1992 and 2011. We compare the auditor’s duties, described by the auditing standards, with the description of the fraud cases as found in the press articles. We draw upon prior research to identify three sources of the expectation gap: deficient performance, deficient standards, and unreasonable expectations. The results of our analysis provide evidence that (1) the performance gap can be reduced by strengthening auditor’s willingness and ability to apply existing auditing standards concerning fraud detection; (2) the standards gap can be narrowed by improving existing auditing standards; and (3) unreasonable expectations, however, involve elements beyond the profession’s sphere of control. As a result, the expectation gap is unlikely to disappear given the media’s tendency to bias, with an overemphasis of unreasonable expectations in their coverage of frauds and press articles tending to reinforce the view that the auditor should take more responsibility for detecting fraud, irrespective of whether this is feasible at a reasonable cost. In addition to the primary role of the press in perpetuating the expectation gap, a second reason for continuation of the expectation gap is that the rational auditor will have difficulty in assessing subjective components of fraudulent behavior.', 'title': 'Media Bias and the Persistence of the Expectation Gap: An Analysis of Press Articles on Corporate Fraud'}\n",

Recent food fraud scandals have attracted particular attention of the public and authorities. The fight against food fraud is still hampered by a lack of a clear definition stating which facts constitute a legal case of food fraud. Against this background, an online survey was conducted in the official food control authorities of the German federal states to obtain an overview of the facts considered as food fraud and to identify factors which, according to the respondents, could be used for the early detection of food fraud. The study was carried out in autumn 2017 with the online software tool Sosci Survey. The data collected was analysed descriptively using Microsoft Excel. The following facts are classified as food fraud by almost all participants: substitution of substances/liquids, imitation of foodstuff, omission of substances/liquids and the concealment of inferior quality of a product. The origin of the foodstuff is considered to be the most important factor in predicting possible food fraud, followed by the product category and price fluctuations. The results of this study show similarities and differences in the understanding of the term food fraud in the official institutions of Germany. Therefore they might be used for the development of a legal definition, which eliminates the identified ambiguities and is a prerequisite for a stringent and congruent fight against food fraud. The identified factors for predicting possible cases of food fraud could be used to develop an early warning system and could thus be part of an overall prevention concept.', 'title': 'How to tackle food fraud in official food control authorities in Germany'}\n",

Currently, the most efficient implementation of distance bounding protocols uses analog processing and enables the prover to receive a message, process it and transmit the reply within 1 ns, two orders of magnitude faster than the most efficient digital implementation. However, even if implementing distance bounding using analog processing clearly provides tighter security guarantees than digital implementations, existing analog implementations do not support resilience against Terrorist Fraud attacks; they protect only against Distance Fraud and Mafia Fraud attacks. We address this problem and propose a new, hybrid digital-analog design that enables the implementation of Terrorist Fraud resilient distance bounding protocols. We introduce a novel attack, which we refer to as the “double read-out” attack and show that our proposed system is also secure against this attack. Our system consists of a prototype prover that provides strong security guarantees: if a dishonest prover performs the Terrorist Fraud attack, it can cheat on its distance bound to the verifier only up to 4.5 m and if it performs Distance Fraud or Mafia Fraud attacks up to 0.41 m. Finally, we show that our system can be used to implement existing (Terrorist Fraud resilient) distance bounding protocols (e.g., the Swiss Knife and Hancke-Kuhn protocol) without requiring protocol modifications.', 'title': 'Design and Implementation of a Terrorist Fraud Resilient Distance Bounding System'}\n",

Our method includes three main phases: data and demands analysis, ontology construction and evaluation. Then, we apply this method to the anti-telephone-fraud field and construct the anti-fraud domain ontology based on cross-domain data. And this ontology represents anti-fraud domain knowledge and it can support intelligent anti-fraud applications, including semantic-based fraud identification and global situation analysis. We finally use quantitative indicators to evaluate the quality of anti-fraud domain ontology. Furthermore, this modeling practice validates the effectiveness of our method for ontology construction and this method can be applied to other domains.', 'title': 'Domain Ontology Construction for Intelligent Anti-Telephone-Fraud Applications'}\n",

In this work, a Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) model for the real-time detection of credit card frauds on the streaming Card-Not-Present (CNP) transactions is investigated with the use of different attributes of card transactions.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach in which anomaly detection and misuse detection models are combined. Sequence alignment is used to determine similarity of an incoming sequence of transactions to both a genuine card holder’s sequence as well as to sequences generated by a validated fraud model.

In this view, beyond the formal sanctions imposed by criminal justice and regulatory agencies, these “control agents” are subject to extra-legal consequences for misconduct or failure to perform their duties in which their reputations for honesty and integrity are diminished and thus their value in the marketplace for their services declines. The “reputational penalty” theory has been challenged by recent work that asserts that these entities, far from controlling the behavior of corporate insiders, may form networks of “reputational intermediaries” who collude with corporate executives to give legitimacy to their illegal schemes. In this paper, empirical support for the latter view is provided through an analysis of a sample of 374 publicly traded firms that announced financial restatements between 1997 and 2002 and which were accused of securities fraud. The analysis shows that these schemes involved large numbers of board members, auditors, and bankers who aided and abetted senior managers in their attempts to deceive investors. These findings point to broader issues concerning: (1) the changing nature of corporate power; (2) the strengths of collusive networks; and (3) current policy debates regarding attempts to exert more regulatory control over corporate behavior.', 'title': 'Reputations and corporate malfeasance: collusive networks in financial statement fraud'}\n",

Fraud, like all crime, and especially corruption, are nonetheless difficult to measure, and this is further compounded by the lack of interest and limitations that sporting bodies have in recognising and then dealing with this problem, as the cases throughout the book will show. The majority of sporting bodies often fail to accept that sport is a victim of fraud or corruption, play down the potential for fraud and corruption or claim that fraud and corruption is under control. This, as we will demonstrate, is far from the truth. Even if these sporting bodies accept the threat fraud and corruption have on the integrity and commercial revenue of sport (Gorse and Chadwick, 2012), the starting point is to record and measure the cases of fraud and corruption and put measures in place that reduce and counteract such a threat.', 'title': 'The Extent of Fraud and Corruption in Sport'}\n",

The sample includes firms that were investigated by the Securities Exchange Commission for fraudulent financial reporting before the Sarbanes–Oxley Act's ethics rule became effective, and their matched no-fraud firms. This study finds that the level of voluntary ethics disclosure was very low compared to the current mandatory disclosure. Results based on a logit regression analysis suggest that firms which made earlier voluntary ethics disclosure were likely to have a larger and more independent audit committee that met more often, and were less likely to engage in fraudulent financial reporting. These results should help policy-makers, investors and boards of directors focus on these audit committee characteristics, which could be crucial not only to ethics disclosure, but also to the ethical conduct of a firm. In particular, results regarding size and meeting frequency highlight how to further improve the effectiveness of an audit committee and the quality of an ethics code not only in the United States, but also in other countries. These characteristics may also indicate a firm's propensity to make any voluntary disclosures, and may help to explain the differential quality of current mandatory ethics codes in the United States. Additionally, these results should be useful to global investors who desire to use corporate governance criteria for screening stock investments in countries where there are no ethics-code requirements.\", 'title': 'Audit committee characteristics and earlier voluntary ethics disclosure among fraud and no-fraud firms'}\n",

In 2015, China had 146,000 internet cafes with 20 million daily users. While internet cafes are highly popular among youth in China and play important sociopolitical roles in Chinese civic life, there have been deep anxieties over the risks posed by the pubic techno-social space to young people. Through a survey of young women internet cafe users and interviews with cafe staff, this chapter shows how the introduction of communication technology in parts of China intersects with local socialeconomic contexts, gender roles, and impacts cultural norms and family dynamics. Chinese media reports often portray women in the internet café as internet addicts, delinquents, or victims of male predators, presenting them as the problematic “other” in the male-dominated space even though women constitute a significant amount of labor force working in these community businesses. The chapter discusses the question of inequality and implications for digital divide problems at the local level in China and how this reflects the disparities between the norms about “proper” internet use and social expectations of womanhood in China. It also demonstrates a gap between the public concerns and the authorities’ concern with the impact of internet cafes in the Chinese society.', 'title': 'Young Women and Internet Cafés in China: Risks and Aspirations in a Contested Techno-social Space'}\n",

Therefore, building a powerful fraud detection system is paramount. It is noteworthy that fraud detection datasets, by nature, are highly unbalanced. Consequently, almost all of the supervised classifiers, when built on the unbalanced datasets, yield high false negative rates. But, the extant oversampling methods while reducing the false negatives, increase the false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel data oversampling method using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We use GAN and its variant to generate synthetic data of fraudulent transactions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we employ machine learning classifiers on the data balanced by GAN.

Demand has been spreading to economic classes formerly excluded at the same time the supply of high-quality material from natural sources falls, leading to constant searches for as yet undiscovered sites, which may take on the character of gold-rushes. While no doubt criminogenic factors have always existed within the gemstone business, periods of rapid price rise mean stronger temptation for illegal activities. The potential list of economic offenses, civil, regulatory and criminal, associated with the gemstones business includes: illegal mining, environmental offenses, bribery, gun-running, smuggling, “terrorist” (i.e. insurgent) financing, commercial fraud, mining-share swindles, money laundering and, not least, simple theft along with recycling stolen goods. This paper represents an attempt to understand the criminogenic factors in light of the history and current structures of the business. It fits the gemstone trade into a commercial, geo-strategic and sociological matrix, the three often interacting in mutually reinforcing ways. It asks whether, given the incentives and opportunities for illicit activity, relying primarily on industry self-regulation makes sense. But it questions whether the international regulatory regime now in place for diamonds can be applied to the far more diffuse supply-side of the colored gemstone market. The paper is divided into three parts. The first, “Under the Rainbow,” examined the shady side of gemstone mining in a geo-political context. The second “In the Eye of the Beholder” looked at fraud in cutting and polishing of rough gemstones into finished gems. The third, the current one, entitled “Hot Rocks, Cold Cash,” focuses on illicit activity in the retail jewelry trade.', 'title': 'The underworld of gemstones'}\n",

This led to theoretical and practical implications such as Triple Bottom Line (TBL) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). These frameworks try to measure and implement sustainable actions in business practices.

On the other hand, Australia`s economy is suffering from low productivity and efficiency and also has one of the worst performances in regard to the environment and climate change compared to other advanced nations; therefore, IoT technology can offer a variety of solutions to tackle those issues and develop a wide range of industries and businesses, from mining to healthcare. IoT application from an Australian perspective was investigated in this study in terms of awareness factors, opportunities and challenges. In order to do so, a comprehensive survey was designed and conducted in Western Australia in 2019 to study citizens’ opinion and knowledge on various topics regarding sustainability and IoT application in Australia.

This higher CSR performance by fraudulent firms is achieved by means of investing in both stakeholder and third-party CSR categories and by improving in CSR strengths.

The Internet has certain unique factors which make eParticipation and eGovernance particularly appealing, namely the size and extent of the Internet, which enables it to be a medium whereby information can be very widely dispersed. This in turn has made political participation easy online. However, there is also a propensity of ICT to be used to interfere with our right to privacy. There is a need to factor in present and future requirements in the scope of eDemocracy and eGovernance generally, and one of the key issues is the devising of methods to narrow the prevailing digital divide. There is also more need for creation of adequate support tools to enable the user to navigate through vast contents, while also engaging and interacting in a meaningful manner with others. For eDemocracy to flourish, what is needed are newer versions of ICT, interest in eDemocracy (both by the government and public), suitable legislation, financing, and a generally conducive environment for enhancement of democratic ideals. However, by its very nature, technology is not inherently democratic. To indulge in eParticipation, we need to understand the concept of ePersonality. This in turn leads us to the question of what is an ePerson? In order to enable the ePersonality to flourish, the authors propose the need to create a parallel online universe, where rights and liabilities mirror those found in our various earthly conventions and declarations related to human, cultural and political rights, but where the distinction between the real world and the online world persists—thereby creating a situation wherein the twain shall coexist but never meet.

This paper proposes an IDS combining three approaches such as anomaly, misuse and decision making model to produce better detection accuracy and a decreased false positive rate. The integrated IDS can be built to detect the attacks in credit card system using Hidden Markov approach in the anomaly detection module. The credit card holder’s behaviours are taken as attributes and the anomalous transactions are found by the spending profile of the user. The transactions that are considered to be anomalous or abnormal are then sent to the misuse detection system. Here, the transactions are compared with predefined attack types and then sent to the decision making model to classify it as known/unknown type of attack. Finally, the decision-making module is used to integrate the detected results and report the types of attacks in credit card system. As abnormal transactions are analyzed carefully in each of the module, the fraud rate is reduced and system is immune to attacks.', 'title': 'An Integrated Intrusion Detection System for Credit Card Fraud Detection'}\n",

Manipulations contribute to mispricing, market imperfections and an increase in transaction costs for market participants and in costs of capital for issuers. Manipulations are facilitated by increased transaction velocity, speculative trading and abusive usage of new trading technologies, i.e., they are directly linked to financial sector changes that drive financialization. Research at the intersection of financialization and IS might support regulatory authorities and market operators in improving market surveillance and helping to detect fraudulent activities. However, confusing terminology is prevalent on financial markets with respect to different manipulation techniques and their characteristics, which hampers efficient fraud detection. Furthermore, recognizing manipulations is challenging given the large number of information sources and the vast number of trades occurring not least because of high-frequency traders. Therefore, automated market surveillance tools require a comprehensive taxonomy of financial market manipulations as a basis for appropriate configuration. Based on a cluster analysis of SEC litigation releases, a review of the latest market abuse regulation and academic studies, we develop a taxonomy of manipulations that structures and details existing manipulation techniques and reveals how these techniques differ along several dimensions.

The fact that we observe hardly any fraud cases may be due to low incentives to detect fraud. Although the costs of gathering information leading to the detection of fraud in crowdfunding might be lower than in the corporate world in general, the benefits might be low as well because many investors participating in a campaign contribute only small amounts and cannot coordinate their efforts to detect fraud. Reviewing the existing evidence on potentially fraudulent behavior by backers, borrowers and entrepreneurs Hainz shows its limitations.

In the article, we operationalize white-collar crimes as bankruptcy frauds. Economic models maintain that interlinkages between firms may give ‘domino effects’: bankruptcy events could lead to ‘bankruptcy chains’ in which a bankruptcy spreads to other firms. Analogously, criminologists assert that social and economic networks can be a major source of fraud diffusion, with the potential to drive other firms bankrupt. Recent empirical results show that crimes may have detrimental and even asymmetric (nonlinear) effects on economic activity. We analyze the diffusion and the aggregate development of bankruptcy frauds in Sweden over nearly two hundred years, specifically focusing on the relationship between bankruptcy frauds and the bankruptcy volume. We also consider linkages between bankruptcy frauds, bankruptcies, and the macroeconomic cycle.MethodsWe use long, aggregate time series, collected from several different historical and contemporary sources. Applying the recently developed cointegrating nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model, we investigate whether the bankruptcy volume reacts asymmetrically to increases and decreases in bankruptcy frauds, both in the short and the long run.ResultsBankruptcy frauds reveal a causal effect on bankruptcies, showing an asymmetric (nonlinear) diffusion effect from economic frauds to the bankruptcy volume. Increases in bankruptcy frauds have a positive and significant effect on the bankruptcy volume. However, decreases in bankruptcy frauds show no significant effect. No causal relationship between the macroeconomic cycle and bankruptcy frauds is found.ConclusionsOur data and research approach demonstrate how previously generated hypotheses in both criminology and economic research on the relationship between (economic) crimes, economic activity, and the diffusion of white-collar crime can be tested at an aggregate level.', 'title': 'The Asymmetric Effect of Bankruptcy Fraud in Sweden: A Long-Term Perspective'}\n",

Big data has played critical role in many decision makings and forecasting domains such as recommendation systems, business analysis, healthcare, web display advertising, clinicians, transportation, fraud detection and tourism marketing. The rapid development of various big data tools such as Hadoop, Storm, Spark, Flink, Kafka and Pig in research and industrial communities has allowed the huge number of data to be distributed, communicated and processed. Big data applications use big data analytics techniques to efficiently analyze large amounts of data. However, choosing the suitable big data tools based on batch and stream data processing and analytics techniques for development a big data system are difficult due to the challenges in processing and applying big data. Practitioners and researchers who are developing big data systems have inadequate information about the current technology and requirement concerning the big data platform. Hence, the strengths and weaknesses of big data technologies and effective solutions for Big Data challenges are needed to be discussed. Hence, due to that, this paper presents a review of the literature that analyzes the use of big data tools and big data analytics techniques in areas like health and medical care, social networking and internet, government and public sector, natural resource management, economic and business sector. The goals of this paper are to (1) understand the trend of big data-related research and current frames of big data technologies; (2) identify trends in the use or research of big data tools based on batch and stream processing and big data analytics techniques; (3) assist and provide new researchers and practitioners to place new research activity in this domain appropriately.

The purpose, relevant to other countries which also face (or evade) problems of policy outreach, is to consider what is required to achieve effective implementation through three broad aspects: aims, ownership, and impact. There is a particular focus on the assessment of the strategy implementation process and what mechanisms translate strategies into effective delivery or what other factors may subvert that delivery. The empirical research draws on the UK government’s 2006 policy review on fraud and the consequential changes between then and 2019, including a number of fraud strategies initiated by the United Kingdom central government. To review implementation in practice, it focuses on the 2011 local government strategy and uses a local-level case study to assess issues concerning aims, ownership, and impact, as well as the effect of other nationally determined policies and agendas. It concludes that without an ‘owned’ strategy implementation process as a whole, national strategies concerning the prevention and policing of fraud in England in the twenty-first century have had—and continue to have—modest impact on practice on the ground at the local level. We find it plausible that this is true elsewhere in the world, not only for crime control but also for other ‘change’ strategies in the public sector. However, testing that proposition is for researchers in other countries. Our aim here is to use this superficially parochial study to raise more universal questions about how policy designers (and academic researchers) need to take better account of circumstances on the ground, the management of strategy implementation and legitimacy, if their strategies are to be more than merely symbolic rhetoric.', 'title': 'Exploring the ‘Shadows’ in the Implementation Processes for National Anti-fraud Strategies at the Local Level: Aims, Ownership, and Impact'}\n",

The purpose of developing the framework is twofold: (1) to draw attention to important yet under-researched aspects of ethical decision-making, and (2) to increase our understanding of the psychology \\tof committing fraud. Our framework builds on the existing fraud triangle (PCAOB, Consideration of fraud in a financial statement audit. AU Section 316, www.pcaobus.org, 2005) which is used by auditors to assess fraud risk. The fraud triangle is composed of three factors that, together, predict the likelihood of fraud within an organization: opportunity, incentive/pressure, and attitude/rationalization. We find that, when faced with the opportunity and incentive/pressure, there are three psychological pathways to fraud nestled within attitude/rationalization: (1) lack of awareness, (2) intuition coupled with rationalization, and (3) reasoning. These distinctions are important for fraud prevention because each of these paths is driven by a different psychological mechanism. This framework is useful in a number of ways. First, it identifies certain insidious situational factors in which individuals commit fraud without recognizing it. Second, it extends our knowledge of rationalization by theorizing that individuals use rationalization to avoid or reduce the negative affect that accompanies performing an unethical behavior. Negative affect is important because individuals wish to avoid it. Third, it identifies several other methods fraudsters use to reduce negative affect, each of which could serve as potential “psychological red flags” and helps predict future fraudulent behavior. Finally, our framework can be used as a theoretical foundation to explore several interventions designed to prevent fraud.', 'title': 'Psychological Pathways to Fraud: Understanding and Preventing Fraud in Organizations'}\n",

The reason for this increase in research activity can be attributed to the huge annual financial losses incurred by card issuers due to fraudulent use of their card products. A successful strategy for dealing with fraud can quite literally mean millions of dollars in savings per year on operational costs. Artificial neural networks have come to the front as an at least partially successful method for fraud detection. The success of neural networks in this field is, however, limited by their underlying design - a feedforward neural network is simply a static mapping of input vectors to output vectors, and as such is incapable of adapting to changing shopping profiles of legitimate card holders. Thus, fraud detection systems in use today are plagued by misclassifications and their usefulness is hampered by high false positive rates. We address this problem by proposing the use of a dynamic machine learning method in an attempt to model the time series inherent in sequences of same card transactions. We believe that, instead of looking at individual transactions, it makes more sense to look at sequences of transactions as a whole; a technique that can model time in this context will be more robust to minor shifts in legitimate shopping behaviour. In order to form a clear basis for comparison, we did some investigative research on feature selection, preprocessing, and on the selection of performance measures; the latter will facilitate comparison of results obtained by applying machine learning methods to the biased data sets largely associated with fraud detection. We ran experiments on real world credit card transactional data using two innovative machine learning techniques: the support vector machine (SVM) and the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM).', 'title': 'Credit Card Transactions, Fraud Detection, and Machine Learning: Modelling Time with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks'}\n",

By designing a process that can identify sites based on their criminality, law enforcement officers can devote their resources to finding the people behind the sites, rather than having to spend time identifying the sites themselves. The scope of the study in this chapter is focused solely on Tor’s hidden services. The research problem was to identify what percentage of hidden services are accessible and how many of these are connected to criminal/illicit activities. Additionally, our research also aims to determine if it is possible to automate a system to identify sites of interest for law enforcement by categorising them based on the prevalent crime type of the hidden service. In this chapter, we look at how hidden services are set up. To facilitate this, an experiment was conducted where a hidden service was set up and hosted on the Tor network. It is connected to the Tor network and obtained an un-attributable IP address, identified over 12,800 .onion addresses from which it scraped the HTML from the home page, before checking this against a pre-determined list of keywords to identify illicit sites and categorise each of these dependant on their type of criminality. Our approach successfully identified criminal sites without the need for human interaction making it a very useful triage solution. Whilst further work is required before its categorisation process is sufficiently robust enough to provide an accurate, unquestionable strategic overview of hidden services, the tool in essence, works very well in achieving its primary function; to identify criminal sites across the dark web.', 'title': 'Towards an Automated Process to Categorise Tor’s Hidden Services'}\n",

Against this background, this article pursues two aims: 1) to develop a thorough conceptual framework to define and operationalize cybercrime affecting businesses as well as its impact, harms, and costs; and 2) to test this conceptual framework with a survey of businesses based in Belgium, which was administered in summer 2016 and elicited 310 valid responses.

Drawing on Greenfield and Paoli’s Harm Assessment Framework (The British Journal of Criminology, 53, 864–885, 2013), we understand impact as the overall harm of cybercrime, that is, the “sum” of the harms to material support, or costs, and the harms to other interest dimensions i.e., functional (or operational) integrity, reputation and privacy. Whereas we ask respondents to provide a monetary estimate of the costs, respondents are invited to rate the severity of the harms on the basis of an ordinal scale. We claim that this “double track” gives a fuller, more valid assessment of cybercrime impact. Whereas most affected businesses do not report major costs or harm, 15% to 20% of them rate the harms to their internal operational activities as serious or more, with cyber extortion regarded as most harmful.', 'title': 'The impact of cybercrime on businesses: a novel conceptual framework and its application to Belgium'}\n",

A systematic review of quantitative research evidence was conducted, followed by a search of governmental reports, policy and position statements, and health guidelines in the last decade.

Prevention studies have mainly involved school-based programs to train healthier Internet use habits in adolescents. The efficacy of selective prevention is promising but warrants further empirical attention. On an international scale, the formal recognition of gaming or Internet use as a disorder or as having quantifiable harms at certain levels of usage has been foundational to developing structured prevention responses.

During this administration, programmes such as the Technology Opportunities Programme (TOP) under the Department of Commerce and the Community Technology Centre (CTC) initiative and the E-rate administered by the Department of Education were put into place to increase Internet access among American citizens, particularly disadvantaged groups. A purist, however, might start this timeline in January 2000.', 'title': 'Support for Online Voting in the United States'}\n",

The societal repercussions are profound, affecting as many as seven million older Americans, with monies exploited estimated as $2.9 billion annually. The many variables that contribute to financial exploitation of older persons in the United States include a cohort effect of unprecedented wealth, trust, and generosity in an unparalleled number of aging persons into physically frailty and cognitive impairment, creating a concerning environment of vulnerability to abuse and financial exploitation. There are additional concerns that financial exploitation is on the rise, with an expanding list of perpetrators that include more than just family or caregivers.

All objects have to be equipped with an electronic product code such as RFID tags. Because of minimizing the price, RFID environments are resource-scarce, then designing ultra-lightweight authentication protocols is of great importance. Many ultra-lightweight authentication protocols such as HB family protocols are proposed. One of the most important threats against HB family protocols is a type of man-in-the-middle attack called GRS. Also, in the real world, IoT requires mutual authentication that traditional HB protocols do not support it. Besides, misconceptions about reader-tag distance could create problems in several applications especially in contactless systems such as access control and electronic payment systems, which could be damaged by distance-based frauds. In the present work, we have proposed a novel distance bounding protocol based on HB family protocols with four major characteristics: (1) it can resist terrorist, mafia, and distance fraud attacks; (2) it is a lightweight mutual authentication protocol capable of being used in low-cost IoT equipment such as NFC and RFID; (3) it employs a hard problem that be post-quantum resistant, and (4) it identifies and solves the weaknesses of HB protocols including GRS attacks. The proposed protocol has also been shown to be able to address the known weaknesses and attacks in distance frauds and HB family protocols.', 'title': 'An Ultra-Lightweight Mutual Authentication Protocol Based on LPN Problem with Distance Fraud Resistant'}\n",

The weaker the paradigm is, the more these two types of expertise begin to blur; what constitutes an act of contribution becomes unclear. I highlight a criterion of “reasonableness” and “significance” as being key to “contribution”. A claim that is unreasonable or trivial will either not be taken seriously, or draw too much critical attention, both unsuitable for fraud. What is deemed “reasonable” or “significant”, however, is relative to the field of practice: in some sciences, different practitioners are allowed to hold fundamentally contradictory positions, whereas in others rejection of a widely accepted belief would be taken to signify poor practice.', 'title': 'The Structure of Scientific Fraud: The Relationship Between Paradigms and Misconduct'}\n",

Using Canada's recently enacted corporate criminal liability (safety crimes) and markets fraud legislation as its empirical focus, it seeks to explain why these laws were introduced, only to fall into a state of virtual disuse. The authors explain how, in the wake of yet another crisis in capitalism, the state felt compelled to enact criminal laws to offset the abuses of corporate power in these two arenas. However, despite promises to 'get tough' on corporate crime, the enforcement of both laws has been sporadic and, in many respects, non-existent. The authors argue that both the passage and the ineffectiveness of Canada's safety crimes and markets fraud legislation can be traced to their shared Keynesian origins as responses to a crisis in neoclassical economics. In essence, both laws are caught-up in a tug-of-war between two opposing yet not incompatible visions of how best to regulate the capitalist marketplace. As a result, even if some corporations and corporate actors are held to legal account, the underlying causes of corporate crime, including the class-based exploitation that is fundamental to capitalism, remain untouched. The authors conclude by arguing for enforcement of corporate crime laws that recognizes the limits of this struggle and the necessity to stave-off capitalism's endemic harms.\", 'title': '“Moral Panics” Deflected: The Failed Legislative Response to Canada’s Safety Crimes and Markets Fraud Legislation'}\n",

Moreover, traditional content-based analysis methods need to keep up with the times, which need to be retrained when the structure of users’ data changes or when the malicious contents come along with some pop cultures. With the purpose of reducing the dependence on network providers’ computing resources and improving the precision of detection, a novel detection method of malicious account, which bases on dynamic users’ reputation information propagation, is proposed in this paper. According to the comparison result of requesting user’s comprehensive reputation and malicious threshold, user can mark requesting user’s reputation so as to achieve the purpose of malicious account detection and providing indirect recommended reputation information about requesting user for other users.

A population of payments made to a given provider during a given time frame is isolated and a probability sample selected for investigation. For each claim or claim detail line, the overpayment is defined to be the amount paid minus the amount that should have been paid, given all evidence collected by the investigator. Current procedures stipulate that, using the probability sample’s observed overpayments, a 90% lower confidence bound for the total overpayment over the entire population is to be used as a recoupment demand to the provider. It is not unusual for these recoupment demands to exceed a million dollars. It is also not unusual for the statistical methods used in sampling and calculating the recoupment demand to be challenged in court.Though it is quite conservative in most settings, for certain types of overpayment populations the standard method for computing a lower confidence bound on the population total, based on the Central Limit Theorem, can fail badly even at relatively large sample sizes. Here, we develop “nonparametric sampling” inferential methods using simple random samples and the hypergeometric distribution, and study their performance on four real payment populations. These new methods are found to provide more than the nominal coverage probability for lower confidence bounds regardless of sample size, and to be surprisingly efficient relative to the Central Limit Theorem bounds in settings where overpayments are essentially all-or-nothing and where the payment population is relatively homogeneous and well separated from zero. The new methods are especially well-suited for sampling payment populations for providers of motorized wheelchairs, which at the time of this article’s submission was a national crisis. Extensions to stratified random samples and to settings where there are frequent partial overpayments are discussed.', 'title': 'The Minimum Sum Method: A Distribution-Free Sampling Procedure for Medicare Fraud Investigations'}\n",

The proposed fraud detection system (FDS) consists of four components, namely, rule-based deviation detector, Dempster-Shafer component, call history database and Bayesian learning. In the rule-based component, we determine the suspicion level of each incoming call based on the extent to which it deviates from expected call patterns. Dempster-Shafer’s theory is used to combine multiple evidences from the rule-based component and an overall suspicion score is computed. A call is classified as normal, abnormal, or suspicious depending on this suspicion score. Once a call from a mobile phone is found to be suspicious, belief is further strengthened or weakened based on the similarity with fraudulent or genuine call history using Bayesian learning. Our experimental results show that the method is very promising in detecting fraudulent behavior without raising too many false alarms.', 'title': 'Use of Dempster-Shafer Theory and Bayesian Inferencing for Fraud Detection in Mobile Communication Networks'}\n",

Hence even common crime can benefit of new modus operandi and new routes to deliver illegal goods or services, enforcing new investigation techniques to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). This paper formerly analyses the goods/services categories of fourteen Tor marketplaces and the related vendors, while the last one provides a discussion on a novel investigative technique related to PGP Keys inter-relations. In particular, with the evolution/growth of the markets, the vendors are increasingly adopting open source tools and technologies, as PGP, which can be exploited to infer information such as the established relationships between users.

We explore the agreement among students and groups of students concerning specific deterrent strategies. We find two types of strategies, student action and faculty/administration action. Results from 740 students surveyed found that the most widely supported strategies are stronger penalties, parental notification, an anonymous tip line, and administering a uniform policy. The least supported strategies were academic honor code, no strategy at all, requiring an ethics course, and leaving individual instructors to determine penalties.

The efficiency of different audit strategies is compared using a computer-based optimization algorithm. Two types of audit strategies are used. One is to adapt the audit intensity to the propensity for errors and fraud in different segments of the group studied. This type of strategy is denoted segmentation strategy. The second type of audit strategy is based on adaptation of behaviour through information. The model developed by Erard and Feinstein for tax auditing is adapted for benefit fraud. In this model, the audit intensity is controlled by a variable, and the auditees are informed of the relationship between control variable and audit intensity. The control variable used in this paper is the benefit amount claimed during a certain period. As the audit intensity increases with the claim amount, the rational fraudster understands that reducing the amount of fraud decreases the risk of being audited. This type of strategy is denoted information strategy. One main result is that the Erard and Feinstein model can be successfully adapted to benefit fraud. Using coarse estimates of audit unit costs, the result of the study is that all persons should be audited. For higher audit costs, it is shown that the information strategy is much more effective when compared to the segmentation strategy.', 'title': 'Optimal auditing of social benefit fraud: a case study'}\n",

Accordingly, effectively detecting fraud reviews is becoming a critical task for cybersecurity. Although various efforts have been put on fraud review detection, they may fail in the case of cold-start where a review is posted by a new user who just pops up on social media. The main reason lies in lacking sufficient historical information of the new user. Recently, limited research has been conducted on fraud review detection with the cold-start problem, in which, however, advanced methods either ignore complex collaborative review manipulations or overlook fraud-related characteristics. As a result, they may easily be deceived by camouflage fraudsters and have low detection precision. This paper presents a novel socially-attentive user representation learning method for fraud review detection with the cold-start problem, namely SATURN, which leverages the fraud-related user reviewing behavior with comprehensive user social couplings for cold-start fraud review detection. SATURN jointly embeds user-item-attitude-review entities relations, explicit and implicit hierarchical social couplings, and fraud-related information into a user vector representation space, in which the fraud-related representation of a new user can be effectively inferred according to the learned socially-attentive entities relation. Subsequently, SATURN effectively detects fraud reviews with the cold-start problem in its learned representation space. Extensive experiments on four large real-world data sets demonstrate SATURN significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art and two baseline competitors in terms of both general and cold-start fraud review detection tasks.', 'title': 'Socially-Attentive Representation Learning for Cold-Start Fraud Review Detection'}\n",

One major public–private partnership that evolved from former First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move initiative—the Partnership for a Healthier America—serves as a case study in this paper, which analyzes the consequences and social harms perpetuated by a public health campaign bound by the imperative to maximize profit. By using trusted state actors to deliver accurate but deceptive claims about food companies’ commitment to public health, this public–private partnership actively misleads the public and potentially exacerbates public health challenges, warranting a skeptical revision of how we understand corporate social responsibility and neoliberal governance on issues of health and nutrition. As a form of fraud, these attempts to mislead the public go beyond the actions of public sector individuals or members of corporate boards, but are structurally incentivized by the legal rights, regulatory privileges, and profit-related incentives central to the modern corporate form. While conventional criminological research tends to underemphasize state and corporate harms, we make use of a critical criminological perspective to analyze state-corporate partnerships in the space between food industry practices and public health policy.', 'title': 'Food Fraud and the Partnership for a ‘Healthier’ America: A Case Study in State-Corporate Crime'}\n",

They are faced with increasing levels of international trade, which pressurizes regulatory control. Governments therefore rely on data mining to focus their limited resources on the most likely fraud cases. The literature on data mining for customs fraud detection lacks in two main directions that are simultaneously addressed in this paper: (1) behavioural and high-cardinality data types are neglected due to a lack of methodology to include them. We demonstrate that such fine-grained features (e.g. the specific entities such as consignee, consignor and declarant and the commodities involved in a declaration) are very predictive. (2) Studies in the tax domain most often use standard learning algorithms on their fraud detection applications. However, customs data are highly imbalanced and this poses challenges for many inducers. We present a new EasyEnsemble method that integrates a support vector machine base learner in a confidence-rated boosting algorithm. This results in a fast and scalable learner that is able to drastically improve predictive performance over the base application of a support vector machine. The results of our proposed framework reveals high AUC and lift values that translate into an immediate impact on the customs fraud detection domain through an improved retrieval of tax losses and an enhanced deterrence.', 'title': 'Customs fraud detection'}\n",

This subverts the typical “cyber-optimist” argument inherent in some ISP corporate philosophy that the internet can impose international norms of communication across a range of states. Rather, this article suggests that the argument for the value of ISPs should lie in how they augment national cultures of communication in ways that parallel domestic, non-state media outlets. This contradicts the rather dominant conception of ISPs as a sort of a “Trojan Horse” of information (Tsui cited in MacKinnon 2011, p. 34), a conduit through which alien and possibly dangerous information is embedded within a domestic media system.

It can detect various categories of malware, including spamming botnets, premium service fraud, and spyware.

Many companies have operationalized this by instituting a sub-certification process and requiring lower-level managers to sign certification statements. These lower-level organizational members are often the individuals who are aware of fraud and are in the best position to provide information on the fraudulent act. However, the sub-certification process may have the effect of reducing employees’ intentions to report wrongdoing. We suggest that subordinates with knowledge of a superior who committed a fraudulent act and certified that there is no fraud will feel less personal responsibility to report the act, thus, decreasing reporting intentions. Additionally, we suggest that if the fraud is discovered subsequent to the reports being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), employees will perceive lower management responsiveness to investigate the fraud, which will reduce intentions to report. Using an experimental approach, we manipulate two between-participant variables: (1) the presence or absence of sub-certification by the transgressor and (2) the timing of fraud discovery, either before or after the reports have been filed with the SEC. We find that when sub-certification is present, perceived personal responsibility and intentions to report were diminished compared to when sub-certification is absent. Timing of the discovery of the fraudulent act did not influence perceived management responsiveness or reporting intentions. Supplemental analysis shows that personal responsibility partially mediates the relationship between sub-certification and reporting intentions. Our findings suggest that audit committees and senior executives may want to carefully consider the costs and benefits of the sub-certification process.', 'title': 'An Examination of Financial Sub-certification and Timing of Fraud Discovery on Employee Whistleblowing Reporting Intentions'}\n",

Having an efficient fraud detection method has become a necessity for all banks in order to minimize such losses. In fact, credit card fraud detection system involves a major challenge: the credit card fraud data sets are highly imbalanced since the number of fraudulent transactions is much smaller than the legitimate ones. Thus, many of traditional classifiers often fail to detect minority class objects for these skewed data sets. This paper aims first: to enhance classified performance of the minority of credit card fraud instances in the imbalanced data set, for that we propose a sampling method based on the K-means clustering and the genetic algorithm. We used K-means algorithm to cluster and group the minority kind of sample, and in each cluster we use the genetic algorithm to gain the new samples and construct an accurate fraud detection classifier.', 'title': 'Using Genetic Algorithm to Improve Classification of Imbalanced Datasets for Credit Card Fraud Detection'}\n",

The societal repercussions are profound, affecting as many as seven million elderly Americans, with monies exploited estimated as $2.9 billion annually. The many variables that contribute to financial exploitation of older persons in the United States include a cohort effect of unprecedented wealth, trust, and generosity in an unparalleled number of elderly aging into physically frailty and cognitive impairment, creating a concerning environment of vulnerability to abuse and financial exploitation. There are additional concerns that financial exploitation is on the rise, with an expanding list of perpetrators that include more than just family or caregivers.

To automatically detect liars, three machine-learning classifiers were trained on 40 liars and 40 truth-tellers, and tested on 10 unseen liars and 10 truth-tellers.

Reports of individuals masquerading as professionals via the Internet often reveal that these imposters cause harm to the unwary victims who rely on assertions of professional expertise. Such reports motivated the authors to examine the origins and evolution of the traditional roles of professions and professionals in today’s society, as well as question how, or whether, the standards for professional practice have been adapted to the challenges posed by technology, i.e., do statements of professional ethics provide a ‘guiding light’ for practitioners and their clients in the cyber age? The authors challenge the professions to consider the notion that technology forces a confrontation between the guild-like aspects of a profession that have served, on the one hand, to protect a profession from encroachment and, on the other hand, have purportedly protected the public.The authors conclude by presenting an examination of websites that show recognition of the challenges that the Internet poses to professionalism, as we have known it.

Recent research demonstrates that public perceptions of white-collar crime and attitudes toward the punishment of white-collar offenders have become more punitive. Along these lines, a neglected area of research concerns those individuals who routinely face white-collar crimes: fraud investigators. Using data collected during the height of recent corporate scandals (2001–02), this study examines the perceptions of 663 fraud investigators and extends prior research by considering the influence of investigator characteristics, organizational context (i.e., size, setting, internal controls, and resource capacity), case characteristics (i.e., offense type, financial loss, and sanction), and offender characteristics on legal professionals’ general and specific punishment perceptions. Results indicate that organizational resources increase the likelihood of both outcomes. Additionally, the correlates of general and specific punishment perceptions are found to differ: government agency context influences general but not specific perceptions. Comparatively, the perception that fraud is increasing and a sanction that includes incarceration each have a significant, positive influence on specific punishment perceptions. Implications of these findings for future research and policy are discussed.', 'title': 'And justice for all? Investigators’ perceptions of punishment for fraud perpetrators'}\n",

This makes healthcare fraud difficult to detect, especially when there are considerably less fraudulent transactions (documented and readily available) than non-fraudulent. The ability to successfully detect fraudulent activities in healthcare, given such discrepancies, can garner up to $350 billion in recovered monetary losses. In machine learning, when one class has a substantially larger number of instances (majority) compared to the other (minority), this is known as class imbalance. In this paper, we focus specifically on Medicare, utilizing three ‘Big Data’ Medicare claims datasets with real-world fraudulent physicians. We create a training and test dataset for all three Medicare parts, both separately and combined, to assess fraud detection performance. To emulate class rarity, which indicates particularly severe levels of class imbalance, we generate additional datasets, by removing fraud instances, to determine the effects of rarity on fraud detection performance. Before a machine learning model can be distributed for real-world use, a performance evaluation is necessary to determine the best configuration (e.g. learner, class sampling ratio) and whether the associated error rates are low, indicating good detection rates. With our research, we demonstrate the effects of severe class imbalance and rarity using a training and testing (Train_Test) evaluation method via a hold-out set, and provide our recommendations based on the supervised machine learning results. Additionally, we repeat the same experiments using Cross-Validation, and determine it is a viable substitute for Medicare fraud detection. For machine learning with the severe class imbalance datasets, we found that, as expected, fraud detection performance decreased as the fraudulent instances became more rare. We apply Random Undersampling to both Train_Test and Cross-Validation, for all original and generated datasets, in order to assess potential improvements in fraud detection by reducing the adverse effects of class imbalance and rarity. Overall, our results indicate that the Train_Test method significantly outperforms Cross-Validation.', 'title': 'The effects of class rarity on the evaluation of supervised healthcare fraud detection models'}\n",

In this chapter, we identify and characterize Facebook pages that engage in spreading URLs pointing to malicious domains. We revisit the scope and definition of what is deemed as “malicious” in the modern day Internet, and identify 627 pages publishing untrustworthy information, misleading content, adult and child unsafe content, scams, etc. We perform in-depth characterization of pages through spatial and temporal analysis. Upon analyzing these pages, our findings reveal dominant presence of politically polarized entities engaging in spreading content from untrustworthy web domains. Studying the temporal posting activity of pages reveals that malicious pages are 1.4 times more active daily than benign pages. We further identify collusive behavior within a set of malicious pages spreading adult and pornographic content. Finally, we attempt to automate the process of detecting malicious Facebook pages by extensively experimenting with multiple supervised learning algorithms and multiple feature sets. Artificial neural networks trained on a fixed sized bag-of-words perform the best and achieve a maximum ROC area under curve value of 0.931.', 'title': 'Hiding in Plain Sight: The Anatomy of Malicious Pages on Facebook'}\n",

In this paper, we aim to detect malicious users and power sellers who can harm the healthy growth of an online C2C platform. Using the data set of a major online C2C marketplace called Mercari, we classified undesirable users by building a classification model for banned users. The results of the banned user prediction indicated that most banned users are heavy sellers. Heavy sellers are desirable from the viewpoint of increasing the transaction fee revenue, but many are power sellers who are running full-time businesses on the platform, making it difficult for non-professional sellers to compete, and their dominance may eventually alienate users. Thus, we built another classification model to classify desirable and undesirable power sellers.

Errors might often result from rounding, or more generally from individual preferences for numbers ending in certain digits, such as 0 or 5. We apply fraud detection methods to assess preferences for numbers ending in these digits in order to inform medical decision making.MethodsThe Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes trial tested an approach to telemonitoring that used existing technology; intervention patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009826) were asked to measure their weight daily using a digital scale and to relay measurements using their telephone keypads. First, we estimated the number of weights subject to end-digit preference by dividing the weights by five and comparing the resultant distribution with the uniform distribution. Then, we assessed the characteristics of patients reporting an excess number of weights ending in 0 or 5, adjusting for chance reporting of these values.ResultsOf the 114,867 weight readings reported during the trial, 18.6% were affected by end-digit preference, and the likelihood of these errors occurring increased with the number of days that had elapsed since trial enrolment (odds ratio per day: 1.002, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). At least 105 patients demonstrated end-digit preference (14.9% of those who submitted data); although statistical significance was limited, a pattern emerged that, compared with other patients, they tended to be younger, male, high school graduates and on more medications. Patients with end-digit preference reported greater variability in weight, and they generated an average 2.9 alerts to the telemonitoring system over the six-month trial period (95% CI, 2.3 to 3.5), compared with 2.3 for other patients (95% CI, 2.2 to 2.5).ConclusionsAs well as overshadowing clinically meaningful changes in weight, end-digit preference can lead to false alerts to telemonitoring systems, which may be associated with unnecessary treatment and alert fatigue. In this trial, end-digit preference was common and became increasingly so over time. By applying fraud detection methods to electronic medical data, it is possible to produce clinically significant information that can inform the design of initiatives to improve the accuracy of reporting.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00303212 March 2006.', 'title': 'Assessing the reliability of self-reported weight for the management of heart failure: application of fraud detection methods to a randomised trial of telemonitoring'}\n",

The results of the evaluation are mixed but, generally, not positive. Third-party liability is reasonably applied in the EU when it comes to persons acting in good faith but the standards applied to those acting with some degree of mala fides are less satisfactory. Blacklisting is an ethically unacceptable effort to pressure low-tax countries, while violating their sovereignty, towards revising their policies and adhering to a higher rate of taxation and tax policy standards developed without their input or consent. Public shaming is an inefficient and misleading effort to coerce multinational companies to terminate tax planning strategies. FATCA has triggered a development into global information exchange which raises questions as to the protection of civil liberties. Although, the subject measures are not judged positively, this does not diminish the indispensable role of tax law enforcement as a constituent component of the equilibrium model.

Indeed, fraudulent incidents usually take place in consecutive time steps to gain illegal benefits, which provides unique clues for probing fraudulent behavior by considering a complete behavioral sequence rather than detecting fraud from a snapshot of behavior. Additionally, fraudulent behavior may involve different parties, such that the interaction patterns between sources and targets can help distinguish fraudulent acts from normal behavior. Therefore, in this paper, we model the attributed behavioral sequences generated from consecutive behaviors in order to capture the sequential patterns, while those that deviate from the pattern can be detected as fraudulence. Considering the characteristics of the behavioral sequence, we propose a novel model, NHA-LSTM, by augmenting the traditional LSTM with a modified forget gate, where the interval time between consecutive time steps is considered. Furthermore, we design a self-historical attention mechanism to allow for long time dependencies, which can help identify repeated or cyclical appearances. In addition, we propose an enhanced network embedding method, FraudWalk, to construct embeddings for the nodes in the interaction network with regard to higher-order interactions and particular time constraints for revealing potential group fraudulence. The node embeddings, along with the feature vectors, are fed into the model to capture the interactions between sources and targets. To validate the effectiveness of sequential behavior embeddings, we experiment on a real-world telecommunication dataset with prediction and classification tasks based on the learned embeddings. The experimental results show that the learned embeddings can better identify fraudulent behavior. Finally, we visualize the weights of the attention mechanism to provide a rational interpretation of human behavioral patterns.', 'title': 'Fraud detection via behavioral sequence embedding'}\n",

We call these kind of attacks as mobile spoofing attacks. There has been active work in detecting spoofing attacks (D. Faria and D.

However, these mechanisms only work in static wireless environments, i.e., the victim node has a fixed location. In this chapter, we focus on spoofing attack detection in mobile wireless environments, that is, the wireless devices including the victim node and/or the spoofing node are moving around. Thus, detecting identity fraud launched by mobile agents is important as it allows the network to further exploit a wide range of defense strategies in different network layers, and consequently helps to ensure secure and trustworthy communication in emerging mobile pervasive computing.', 'title': 'Detecting Mobile Agents Using Identity Fraud'}\n",

In a first step we show how suspicious patterns can be identified from known compromised cards. The transactions between cards and shops can be represented as a bipartite graph. We are interested in finding fully connected subgraphs containing mostly compromised cards, because such bicliques reveal suspicious payment patterns. Then we define new attributes which capture the suspiciousness of a transaction indicated by known suspicious patterns. Eventually a non-linear classifier is used to assess the predictive power gained through those new features. The new attributes lead to a significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art aggregated transaction features.

In this work, we propose a neural network architecture which incorporates recently proposed Improved Neural Arithmetic Logic Units.

Further, inspired by a real-world credit payment application, we construct a synthetic benchmark dataset, which reflects the problem setting of automatically capturing such mathematical relations within the data. Our novel network architecture is evaluated on two real-world and two synthetic financial fraud datasets for different network parameters.

Using partial least squares-structural equation modelling, the results illustrated the presence of a negative effect of ‘perceived severity of online risk’ toward online risks, whereas the effect of ‘digital literacy’ was found to be positive. Children whose perception of online risks was more severe were less exposed to online risks if they had higher ‘online privacy concerns’ than the children with higher ‘digital literacy’ who are more exposed to online risk. Results of the study show that engaging in safe online behaviour requires children to have a high perception regarding severity of online risks as well as knowledge of online privacy concerns.

This chapter aims to analyse the development of practices of resistance in relation to antidrug policies, practices that unfold through anonymous drug marketplaces. To explore social practices of informal resistance, the chapter draws on a digital ethnographic study on cryptomarkets. It observes that users on cryptomarkets follow a self-proclaimed libertarian ideology to systematically bypass drug control policies.

To address this drawback, we propose an end-to-end weakly supervised learning network, which is robust to mislabeled web images. Specifically, the proposed attention module automatically eliminates the distraction of those samples with incorrect labels by reducing their attention scores in the training process. On the other hand, the special-class activation map module is designed to stimulate the network by focusing on the significant regions from the samples with correct labels in a weakly supervised learning approach. Besides the process of feature learning, applying regularization to the classifier is considered to minimize the distance of those samples within the same class and maximize the distance between different class centroids.

Assuming trust and distrust are different in their psychological aspects, we propose that trust is a cognitively active construct, whereas distrust is an affectively active construct. To support this proposal, we select six antecedents of trust and distrust and hypothesize their different relationships as follows: 1) Antecedents with capability-based elements, such as site convenience and content relevance, are associated with trust; 2) Antecedents with relationship-affecting elements, such as customer involvement and web fraud, are associated with distrust; 3) Antecedents with both elements, such as content truthfulness and customer responsiveness, are associated with both trust and distrust. A survey is conducted on 279 online shopping mall users in Korea, and the result shows that most of the foregoing hypotheses are supported. The finding suggests: 1) Trust emerges when customers expect positive result with confidence, thereby implying that it is cognitively activated; 2) Distrust emerges when customers suspect that the seller has a vicious motivation, thereby implying that it is affectively activated. From these premises, the present study contributes to the literature by showing how trust and distrust are different, and why they should be managed differently to establish customer loyalty.', 'title': 'Antecedents of cognitive trust and affective distrust and their mediating roles in building customer loyalty'}\n",

As a first step towards a systematic screening tool, especially for journal editors and other staff members who are responsible for quality assurance, such as laboratory supervisors, we propose a basic classification of image manipulation. Based on this classification, we developed and explored some simple algorithms to detect copied areas in images. Using an artificial image and two examples of previously published modified images, we apply quantitative methods such as pixel-wise comparison, a nearest neighbor and a variance algorithm to detect copied-and-pasted areas or duplicated images. We show that our algorithms are able to detect some simple types of image alteration, such as copying and pasting background areas. The variance algorithm detects not only identical, but also very similar areas that differ only by brightness. Further types could, in principle, be implemented in a standardized scanning routine. We detected the copied areas in a proven case of image manipulation in Germany and showed the similarity of two images in a retracted paper from the Kato labs, which has been widely discussed on sites such as pubpeer and retraction watch.', 'title': 'Towards a Systematic Screening Tool for Quality Assurance and Semiautomatic Fraud Detection for Images in the Life Sciences'}\n",

A justification of that hypothesis is only known for multiplicative sequences (Schatte in J Inf Process Cyber EIK 24:443–455, 1988).

We prove that last digits are approximately uniform for distributions with an absolutely continuous distribution function.

However, the research field has focused on techniques which require tedious and expensive hand-crafting of features. In addition, existing works often ignore information related to the network of transactions. Representation learning in graphs tackles both of these challenges. First, it provides the possibility to tap into the relational and structural aspects of the transaction network and leverage these in a predictive model. Second, it featurizes the graph without the need for manual feature engineering. This work contributes to the literature by being the first to explicitly and extensively show how fraud detection modeling can benefit from representation learning. We discern three different approaches in this paper: traditional network featurization, an inductive representation learning algorithm and a transductive representational learner.

International calls have higher values when compared with national ones, which raises the attention of fraudsters. In this paper, we present a solution for a real problem called interconnect bypass fraud, more specifically, a newly identified distributed pattern that crosses different countries and keeps fraudsters from being tracked by almost all fraud detection techniques. This problem is one of the most expressive in the telecommunication domain, and it has some abnormal behaviours like the occurrence of a burst of calls from specific numbers. Based on this assumption, we propose the adoption of a new fast forgetting technique that works together with the Lossy Counting algorithm. We apply frequent set mining to capture distributed patterns from different countries. Our goal is to detect as soon as possible items with abnormal behaviours, e.g., bursts of calls, repetitions, mirrors, distributed behaviours and a small number of calls spread by a vast set of destination numbers. The results show that the application of different techniques improves the detection ratio and not only complements the techniques used by the telecom company but also improves the performance of the Lossy Counting algorithm in terms of run-time, memory used and sensibility to detect the abnormal behaviours. Additionally, the application of frequent set mining allows us to capture distributed fraud patterns.', 'title': 'Interconnect bypass fraud detection: a case study'}\n",

Medicare is a Federal Government healthcare program that provides affordable health insurance to the elderly population and individuals with select disabilities. Unfortunately, there is a significant amount of fraud, waste, and abuse within the Medicare system that costs taxpayers billions of dollars and puts beneficiaries’ health and welfare at risk. Previous work has shown that publicly available Medicare claims data can be leveraged to construct machine learning models capable of automating fraud detection, but challenges associated with class-imbalanced big data hinder performance. With a minority class size of 0.03% and an opportunity to improve existing results, we use the Medicare fraud detection task to compare six deep learning methods designed to address the class imbalance problem. Data-level techniques used in this study include random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), and a hybrid ROS–RUS. The algorithm-level techniques evaluated include a cost-sensitive loss function, the Focal Loss, and the Mean False Error Loss. A range of class ratios are tested by varying sample rates and desirable class-wise performance is achieved by identifying optimal decision thresholds for each model. Neural networks are evaluated on a 20% holdout test set, and results are reported using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results show that ROS and ROS–RUS perform significantly better than baseline and algorithm-level methods with average AUC scores of 0.8505 and 0.8509, while ROS–RUS maximizes efficiency with a 4× speedup in training time. Plain RUS outperforms baseline methods with up to 30× improvements in training time, and all algorithm-level methods are found to produce more stable decision boundaries than baseline methods. Thresholding results suggest that the decision threshold always be optimized using a validation set, as we observe a strong linear relationship between the minority class size and the optimal threshold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare multiple data-level and algorithm-level deep learning methods across a range of class distributions. Additional contributions include a unique analysis of the relationship between minority class size and optimal decision threshold and state-of-the-art performance on the given Medicare fraud detection task.', 'title': 'Medicare fraud detection using neural networks'}\n",

In this domain, one is dealing with various types of medical practitioners, who sometimes specialize in specific patient groups (elderly, disabled, etc.), such that unusual claiming behavior in itself is not cause for suspicion.

However, the effectiveness of UI in driving drug producers to put more effort into meeting the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is yet to be ascertained. In this paper we apply game theory to study the effects of UI on the prevention of drug fraud, drug producers’ profits, and social welfare under scenarios of complete and incomplete information. We show that UI is not always an effective way of supervision. Specifically, if the upper bound on the punishment is not very large, UI can drive the firmto make the largest self-supervision effort only when the firm’s technical level is high and the supervision cost is low. Otherwise, UI cannot drive the firm to make the largest self-supervision effort. Under incomplete information, firms with a high technical level would adopt more self-supervision and make more profit than those with a low technical level. Moreover, we design a new mechanism under incomplete information that can incentive drug producers to make greater self-supervision effort to meet the requirements of GMP under certain conditions.', 'title': 'The Effect of Unannounced Inspection on Prevention of Drug Fraud'}\n",

An exponential growth in Internet traffic has led to ever increasing costs for the provision of these services at a time when most Australian Universities have been experiencing tighter budgetary conditions. Significantly, alongside these financial concerns, Universities have started to recognise the emergence of a range of other issues related directly to the nature of on-line behaviours engaged in by the diversity of users that Universities are now expected to support. These on-line behaviours are challenging Universities to find responses to balancing users’ right to privacy and freedom of speech with the need to protect against legal action arising from criminal, illegal or inappropriate behaviours by some users on University networks. As part of the responses being developed, many Universities have introduced Internet Management Systems (IMS), similar to the systems used by many Internet Services Providers (ISPs). This paper presents a case study on the experience of the University of Tasmania (UTAS) in introducing an IMS. The case study covers the period from the initial ‘call for proposals’ through to the deployment of the new IMS system. The paper highlights that decisions pertaining to the IMS systems have direct implications for balancing the competing rights, interests and requirements of different stakeholders. More specifically the case study highlights the impact of the changing nature of users’ relationships with the Internet and the need for vigilance on the part of users, network administrators, service providers and policy makers. The dangers of failing to get the right balance are presented and the paper argues for the importance of user education, change management and communication throughout the University and its broader community of users. The paper also briefly considers how Australia’s planned accession to the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime may impact on these issues. More broadly, this paper suggests that additional changes will emerge as IPV6, companies like Google and cloud computing architectures reconfigure individual users relationships with ‘their’ information and access to the Internet.

Here, SMOTE is used to widen the data region corresponding to minority samples and random under-sampling of majority class is used for balancing the class distribution. The value difference metric (VDM) is used as distance measure while doing SMOTE. We conducted the experiments with classifiers namely k-NN, Radial Basis Function networks, C4.5 and Naive Bayes with varied levels of SMOTE on insurance fraud dataset. For evaluating the learned classifiers, we have chosen fraud catching rate, non-fraud catching rate in addition to overall accuracy of the classifier as performance measures.

The market exhibits several distinctive features in terms of the size of platforms, the level of market concentration and business models. As online lending gathers moment in China, many problems have come into light. China has recently established a relatively complete regulatory regime for online lending, introducing a number of significant changes, such as the restriction on the business model that can be adopted by platforms, registration requirements, custodian requirements, information disclosure requirements and lending limits. The new regime will have far-reaching implications, including a reshuffling of the market and more collaboration between online lending platforms and traditional banks. A comparative analysis of the Chinese experience with those in other jurisdictions such as the US, the UK, Hong Kong and Japan is conducted to examine the extent to which the new regime is likely to achieve a proper balance between its two main objectives, namely facilitating the growth of the online lending market and protecting financial consumers.

The perpetrator may further complicate matters by routing his attack on the victim in Country B through computers in Countries F and G.

Furthermore, access to the field of football crowd violence is open and available for observational and ethnographic research far more than crime in the boardroom.

Corporate psychopaths are individuals successfully working in organizations, but are selfish, manipulative, and exhibit a lack of empathy, remorse, and conscience; therefore, they may be viewed as risk factors for organizations. While there is abundant literature on the connection between clinical psychopathy and criminal behavior, such research is scarce in the business context where successful psychopaths operate. Thus, we examine if the malevolent traits of corporate psychopaths predict the acceptance of different forms of white-collar crime. In doing so, we conduct two survey studies in which we first measure participants’ psychopathic tendencies and then assess their acceptance of either an accounting fraud or an insider-trading situation. Consistent with our hypotheses and across both studies, we find a highly significant relationship between personality traits that are associated with corporate psychopathy and the acceptance of white-collar crime. This paper discusses the implications of these findings and identifies some potentially useful approaches for excluding corporate psychopaths from organizations.', 'title': 'The influence of psychopathic traits on the acceptance of white-collar crime: do corporate psychopaths cook the books and misuse the news?'}\n",

As data is increasing the storage capacity also has to be increased, and the processing of data from such huge storage may be time consuming. And it is tricky to handle and process such data via conventional software and database procedures, which lead to the research toward big data analytics. It aims at handling of massive data storage with fast processing techniques and to help companies in optimizing business, advancement of operations, making more intelligent, and fast decisions. Hence Big data analytics is an important field that derives insights from the data and prediction system is one of the famous applications of it. It takes the historical data and analyses, and then it forecasts the past and future situations basing on identified hidden patterns of data considered. The analytics can be categorized into different forms namely Business Analytics (BA) and Predictive Analytics (PA). The inclusion of skills, technologies, applications, and processes with statistical techniques adopted by organizations for their data available to impel business planning is referred to as business analytics. The forecasting approach to foresee upcoming events and trends known as Predictive Analytics, which identifies the hidden patterns and determines what is likely to happen from the historical information available using statistical and mathematical models. To enhance the forecasting process, an opinion mining can also be included. Nowadays sentiment of the people also considered to improve the accuracy level of anticipation. Effecting factors should be considered and clearly analyzed to construct accurate model so as to supply most relevant suggestions. Several researchers proposed various prediction algorithms and methods in order to construct the accuracy improved model and user satisfaction. In this chapter, authors studied various anticipating models and discussed their preference criteria. As a part of that, we studied various important preference factors in stock trend prediction and categorized them based on effecting factors.

Participants (n = 140) from seven European countries, participating in the Food4Me intervention study which aimed to test the efficacy of personalised nutrition approaches delivered via the internet, were invited to take part in the VS. Participants visited a research centre in each country within 2 weeks of providing SR data via the internet. Participants received detailed instructions on how to perform each measurement. Individual’s identity was checked visually and by repeated collection and analysis of buccal cell DNA for 33 genetic variants. Validation of identity using genomic information showed perfect concordance between SR and VS. Similar results were found for demographic data (age and sex verification). We observed strong intra-class correlation coefficients between SR and VS for anthropometric data (height 0.990, weight 0.994 and BMI 0.983). However, internet-based SR weight was under-reported (Δ −0.70 kg [−3.6 to 2.1], p < 0.0001) and, therefore, BMI was lower for SR data (Δ −0.29 kg m−2 [−1.5 to 1.0], p < 0.0001).

For the latter, we review the available theory at the individual and group levels that may help individual users, groups and organizations take actions against cyber threats. We end with future research needs and conclusions. In our discussion, we first agreed that cyber threats are making cyber environments more complex and uncomfortable for average users; second, we concluded that various factors are important (e.g., timely actions are often necessary in cyber space to counter the threats of the attacks that commonly occur at internet speeds, but also the ‘slow and low’ attacks that are difficult to detect, threats that occur only after pre-specified conditions have been satisfied that trigger an unsuspecting attack). Third, we concluded that advanced persistent threats (APTs) pose a risk to users but also to national security (viz., the persistent threats posed by other Nations). Fourth, we contend that using “red” teams to search cyber defenses for vulnerabilities encourages users and organizations to better defend themselves. Fifth, the current state of theory leaves many questions unanswered that researchers must pursue to mitigate or neutralize present and future threats.

Using the storytelling research methodology, this paper seeks to highlight why geo-restrictions and regional lockouts over internet-related services seem to be a major challenge for millennials in Africa, who are actors in innovation by virtue of their contribution to the growth of the internet technology. We argue that this enforced regional lockout not only deflates the productivity and creativity of African millennials, but also points to a functionalist view of internet inequality constituted through the \"divides\" of accessibility, censored participation, and acceptability in the internet economy. Understanding the staggering nature of this problem would require telling the stories of young internet entrepreneurs and innovators in Africa, who continue to be marginalized while investing and contributing to the internet economy.', 'title': '‘We are connected, but constrained’: internet inequality and the challenges of millennials in Africa as actors in innovation'}\n",

Findings indicate that there are differences in online activities of gang members and gangs across countries, although levels of offending are largely similar.

Experts and scholars in all fields begin to make many studies of cloud computing infrastructure construction and effective resource utilization.

ITFIN (Internet finance) is the results of finance comprehensively combined with network technology and also a new ecological finance fermenting in this Internet era. In ITFIN, it integrates online transaction data generating in various social network, studies and judges the credit standing of customers, and completes credit consumption, loan and other borrowing behavior by epayment, so that people can enjoy financial services in dealing with various problems. However, one person can play different identities in network, which has posed a severe challenge to ITFIN network security and has largely intensified risk including operational risk, market selection risk and other business risks as well as network and information security risk. Therefore, it is an effective technological approach and operable measure to prevent or eliminate ITFIN risks by establishing a reliable, reasonable and effective ITFIN risk assessment model. This paper conducted theoretical and empirical analysis, then constructed an assessment model against China’s ITFIN risk that integrates rough set and PSO-SVM (particle swarm optimization support vector machine, and finally used this model in China’s ITFIN risk assessment. The empirical research results indicate that, through introducing rough set theory, it could effectively reduce redundant data information, guarantee a reliable, reasonable and scientific model, and enhance classification effect of model.

The understanding of integrity ranges from the minimal, only considering falsification, fabrication and plagiarism, to the maximum, blending into science ethics.

The debate about integrity is usually presented as a single, universal discussion, with shared concerns for researchers, policymakers and ‘the public’. In this article, we show that it is not. There are substantial differences between the language of research integrity in the scientific arena and in the public domain. Notably, scientists and policymakers adopt different approaches to research integrity. Scientists tend to present integrity as a virtue that must be kindled, while policy documents and newspapers stress norm enforcement. Rather than performing a conceptual analysis through philosophical reasoning and discussion, we aimed to clarify the discourse of ‘scientific integrity’ by studying its usage in written documents. To this end, large numbers of scientific publications, policy documents and newspaper articles were analysed by means of scientometric and content analysis techniques. The texts were analysed on their usage of the term ‘integrity’ and of frequently co-occurring terms and concepts. A comparison was made between the usage in the various media, as well as between different periods in which they were published through co-word analysis, mapping co-occurrence networks of significant terms and themes.', 'title': 'Promoting Virtue or Punishing Fraud: Mapping Contrasts in the Language of ‘Scientific Integrity’'}\n",

In the first step, the sample extraction and DART–TOFMS instrumental conditions were optimized to obtain the broadest possible representation of ionizable compounds occurring in the extracts obtained from chicken muscle and feed on which experimental animals were grown. To this end, a simultaneous (all-in-one) extraction procedure was developed employing water and cyclohexane mixture as the extraction solvents. Under these conditions both polar as well as non-polar metabolites were isolated within a single extraction step. In the next step, metabolomic fingerprints of a large set of chicken muscle and feed extracts were acquired. In the final phase, the experimental data were statistically evaluated using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. In general, differentiation of chicken muscle according to diet (feed with and without the addition of chicken bone meal) was feasible. Additional experiments conducted after 6 months confirmed applicability of this approach. Correct classification was obtained based on the assessment of polar as well as non-polar extracts fingerprints.

The findings significantly support the study's hypotheses that shopping orientations such as convenience and recreational shopper and demographic variables such as gender, education, and household income were significantly related to consumer's online purchase preference. The researchers' findings also confirm that the relationships of shopping orientation and demographic variables with purchase preference for shopping online significantly differ by product category. More specifically, convenience and recreational orientations were positively related to preference for shopping online for experience-1, experience-2, and credence product types, though the directional relationship between recreational shopper orientation and preference for shopping on the Internet was positive rather than negative as hypothesized. The results and discussion section also includes implications drawn from the findings.\", 'title': 'Relationship of Type of Product, Shopping Orientations, and Demographics with Preference for Shopping on the Internet'}\n",

The paper emphasizes the balance in the internationalization process between an online and an offline presence in the new international market. The time gap between online and offline presence, the online-to-offline interval, seems to be a critical factor in the internationalization process. The speed of the internet industry and the technically complex nature of online services could explain why the case firms chose controlled modes of entry. The case firms thus skip sequential steps, following a pattern that is in contrast to the Uppsala model. Overall, the paper suggests that finding the right balance between the online and the offline presence is a challenge in the internationalization of these particular Swedish OSP firms.', 'title': 'The online–offline balance: internationalization for Swedish online service providers'}\n",

Convergence has now made possible new avenues through which harms can be perpetrated against children. Difficult policy issues still have to be confronted as policymakers and regulators grapple with the dilemma of using the criminal law, in an environment where enforcement, rather than the application of its substantive rules, is proving to be a problem (Luüders et al., 2009). Additionally, the ramifications of an expanding child protection agenda for civil liberties and innovation are still uncertain (Lindsay et al., 2008). Policymakers and law enforcement are also having to deal with the issue of whether the criminal law should be used in cases where children become the offenders – sexual solicitation of other minors, hacking into social network profiles, posting hateful messages or defacing websites and distributing self-generated nude images of themselves. Is the criminal law outdated and unresponsive, or does living in a risk society require policymakers to reassess how we approach the strategies for extending legal standards and rules to an increasingly connected and “always-on” society? Indeed, it is a particularly relevant question to ask when reflecting on how the criminal law addresses these tensions either through direct State intervention or indirectly through the MSIG framework. These matters provide the background to the chapter, which is the legal and evidentiary issues emerging from the use of the criminal law in managing risks in three areas of online child safety governance: online sexual grooming, exposure to obscene content (with particular emphasis on child pornography) and peer victimisation. I integrate into the analysis an account of the key substantive criminal law rules to highlight its role and shortcomings when addressing the regulatory challenges in this area of child protection policymaking. Finally, some caveats may be necessary with regard to the discussion that follows. This chapter does not rehearse or critique the reports or scholarly works undertaken by researchers in this field (Akdeniz, 2008; Shariff, 2009; Brenner, 2010; Kerr, 2009). Neither does this chapter review the role of criminal law in virtual worlds (Lastowka, 2010). Even though these and other works provide some useful insights on the challenges posed by Web 2.0 technologies to the criminal law, the task undertaken in this chapter is deliberately narrowed to a consideration of three specific forms of online child safety incidents/risk-prone activities. The aim of the discussion is to reflect the nuances of online child safety governance with regard to the standards and principles the criminal law aims to uphold and, more specifically, examine the extent to which Web 2.0 technologies can be said to undermine its ability to promote certainty, order, trust and confidence. The governance challenge for law and its ability to secure compliance with its standards and principles lies at the core of the evolving MSIG framework aimed at confronting parental anxieties resulting from the vulnerabilities children face in an environment of de-centralised networks and information flows. Secondly, the coverage of these areas will be conducted against the background of the national legal system in England and Wales. Where appropriate, references will be made to relevant legislation, case law and materials from Australia, the United States and Canada, noting that some caution should be exercised when making comparisons between the approaches in these jurisdictions, given that governments ground their legal and policy responses on their “legal traditions, approaches, techniques (e.g. direct regulation vs. self- or co-regulation), and law enforcement practices” (Gasser, et al., 2010: 10). The differences in legal traditions and policy responses do not detract from the tasks undertaken in this chapter. The implications of these rules for evidentiary investigations and online intermediary liability will also be identified and explained.', 'title': 'Online Sexual Grooming of Children, Obscene Content and Peer Victimisation: Legal and Evidentiary Issues'}\n",

As the title of this chapter suggests, security is a key concept that underpins the triad of biometrics, identity and citizenship. And like many other concepts, security too has undergone many transformations in its meaning, use and function. As such, it is worth starting off the discussion by considering some of these transformations.

The attacker can direct the victim’s Internet traffic and point the victim to the attacker’s own web sites regardless of what domain the victim thinks he is actually going to, potentially leading to the compromise of the victim’s credentials. The same attack methodology can be used to make other changes to the router, like replacing its firmware. Routers could then host malicious web pages or engage in click fraud.

The proposed fingerprinting scheme can identify if the circuit is original or has been altered by an adversary to hide piracy. Changing a gate to an equivalent counterpart does not change the functionality of the circuit and we assess these as altered circuits. Altering the circuit can arise if an adversary gains access to the register-transfer level (RTL) or netlist of a design in an untrusted supply chain or uses the datasheet to implement a functionally equivalent design. Experimentally we determine that our method can detect a pirated chip with near 100% accuracy when classifying new ICs, and above 96% accuracy when classifying at any age up to 7 years in the presence of noise if at least 2.5% of the gates in the IC have been altered by an adversary.', 'title': 'Implementation-Based Design Fingerprinting for Robust IC Fraud Detection'}\n",

Cyber threats propagate primarily with deception. Threats from deception derive from insider and outsider attacks. These threats are countered by reactive and proactive cyber-defenses. Alarmingly, increasing proactive cyber defenses simulate conflicts from the Wild West of yesteryear. However, deception is inadequately addressed with traditional theories based on methodological individualism (MI). Worse, MI’s rational choice theory breaks down in the presence of social conflict. In contrast, interdependence theory addresses barriers, deception to penetrate the vulnerabilities of barriers and the conflict which ensues, topics where interdependence theory thrives. Interdependence includes the effects of the constructive or destructive interference that constitute every social interaction. Our research primarily addresses the application of interdependence theory to autonomous human-machine teams (A-HMTs), which entails artificial intelligence (AI) and AI’s sub-field of machine learning (ML). A-HMTs require defenses that protect a team from cyberthreats, adverse interference and other vulnerabilities while affording the opportunity for a team to become autonomous. In this chapter, we focus on an introduction that includes a review of traditional methodological individualism and rational choice theory. Our introduction is followed by a discussion of deception and its implications for reactive cyber defenses. We next cover proactive cyber defenses in a separate section. Then we review our research on interdependence theory and its application to A-HMTs. We conclude that while cyber-risks are increasing, so too is the teamwork that strengthens cyber-defenses. The future belongs to a theory of interdependence that improves cyber-defenses, teams and the science that generalizes to A-HMTs.', 'title': 'Cyber-(in)Security, Revisited: Proactive Cyber-Defenses, Interdependence and Autonomous Human-Machine Teams (A-HMTs)'}\n",

Prevention of fraud in any organization is successful when there is a proper, preexisting “tone at the top” in an organization. The importance of setting an example of ethical behavior within an organization is a responsibility of executive management. In this study, a review of board composition characteristics, more specifically, the ratio of corporate boards, is conducted to find a possible correlation with a total of 11 fraud cases of publicly traded corporations in the precious metals industry from the year 2012. This study examines several theories to find a possible linkage between internal and independent corporate board members of publicly traded precious metals firms that possibly have been in violation due to lack of strong corporate culture. Due to the strict regulation of enterprises and financial reporting, companies are now being governed by economic legislations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to ensure investor protection and confidence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is the legislation that connects corporate governance qualities to fraud prevention by enforcing rules that govern management relations for accurate financial reporting. The confidence stems from good leadership, sound corporate culture, and high ethical principles. After notable financial scandals in 2002, enforcement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has served as reinforcement for public firms and financial reporting accountability. This study did not include any cases before 2012. The conclusion of this study is that the emphasis on legislation within financial reporting is a vital area of implementation within an enterprise. Understanding and following accounting rules and regulations is not only critical to corporate governance, but also in contributing to the enhancement of management’s role in accountability.

Additionally, we wanted to demonstrate that other aspects of fish fraud other than speciation are detectable using REIMS.Methods478 samples of five different white fish species were subjected to REIMS analysis using an electrosurgical knife. Each sample was cut 8–12 times with each one lasting 3–5 s and chemometric models were generated based on the mass range m/z 600–950 of each sample.ResultsThe identification of 99 validation samples provided a 98.99% correct classification in which species identification was obtained near-instantaneously (≈\\u20092 s) unlike any other form of food fraud analysis. Significant time comparisons between REIMS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were observed when analysing 6 mislabelled samples demonstrating how REIMS can be used as a complimentary technique to detect fish fraud.

We use a 2×2 between-subjects experimental design with accountability (duty to sign work results vs. no duty to sign) and superior instructions (with vs. without profit maximization cue) as independent variables. Both manipulations of superior instructions reminded people to respect accounting standards and principles but in one condition, an instruction to increase revenues was integrated as profit maximization cue. We expected this cue to trigger a profit maximization decision frame that increases the likelihood for fraudulent revenue recording. 58 managers from an executive MBA class participated in the experiment. We find that superior instructions interact with accountability. Fraudulent revenue recording was particularly observed when people received instructions to increase revenues and had to sign their work results. Consequently, fraudulent behavior can occur without pressure to commit fraud due to profit maximization cues that are communicated by a superior and despite implemented internal control mechanisms.

The labeling is the outcome of an active learning process, as every day human investigators contact only a small number of cardholders (associated with the riskiest transactions) and obtain the class (fraud or genuine) of the related transactions. An adequate selection of the set of cardholders is therefore crucial for an efficient fraud detection process. In this paper, we present a number of active learning strategies and we investigate their fraud detection accuracies. We compare different criteria (supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised) to query unlabeled transactions. Finally, we highlight the existence of an exploitation/exploration trade-off for active learning in the context of fraud detection, which has so far been overlooked in the literature.', 'title': 'Streaming active learning strategies for real-life credit card fraud detection: assessment and visualization'}\n",

One such scale is the nine-item short-form Internet Disorder Scale (IDS9-SF) based on the DSM-5 criteria for internet gaming disorder. Although the IDS9-SF has been validated in a number of languages, it has not been validated into Italian. Therefore, the present study validated the IDS9-SF utilizing an Italian-speaking sample (N\\u2009=\\u20091477). Data were initially collected from 963 participants and the sample was equally split to carry out exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the Italian IDS9-SF. Results showed that two items were problematic (i.e., in terms of asymmetry and kurtosis) so a slightly modified Italian IDS9-SF was developed (modifying the two items). Data were then collected from a further 514 participants to test the modified Italian IDS9-SF. The second sample was again equally split, and EFA and CFA were carried out. The modified Italian IDS9-SF was found to be a psychometrically robust measure for assessing the risk of internet disorder among Italian adults.', 'title': 'Psychometric Validation of the Internet Disorder Scale–Short Form in an Italian Adult Sample'}\n",

Firstly, the transaction mode and operational process of the C2VP2C mode of IFPs were established and three levels of loan matching space were constructed. The study established a penalty model for delinquent borrowers to assess their willingness to repay, and investigated the penalty intensity for defaults. The results show that a greater the penalty coefficient would result in more serious penalties, and with the delay of the repayment, the penalty coefficient showed less changes.

The approach discovers clients that have queried domains contained within identified suspicious domain-to-IP mappings, thus assisting in pinpointing potentially compromised clients within the network. The proposed approach targets compromised clients in large-scale operational networks. We have evaluated the proposed approach using an extensive set of DNS traffic traces from different operational ISP networks. The evaluation illustrates a great potential of accurately identifying suspicious domain-to-IP mappings and potentially compromised clients. Furthermore, the achieved performance indicate that the novel detection approach is promising in view of the adoption in operational ISP networks.

However, a known drawback of this method is that its fitted response is a piecewise constant function, while practical response functions are often required to be continuous. The method proposed in this paper achieves monotonicity and smoothness of the regression by introducing an L2 regularization term. In order to achieve a low computational complexity and at the same time to provide a high predictive power of the method, we introduce a probabilistically motivated approach for selecting the regularization parameters. In addition, we present a technique for correcting inconsistencies on the boundary. We show that the complexity of the proposed method is \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\). Our simulations demonstrate that when the data are large and the expected response is a complicated function (which is typical in machine learning applications) or when there is a change point in the response, the proposed method has a higher predictive power than many of the existing methods.', 'title': 'A smoothed monotonic regression via L2 regularization'}\n",

Braithwaite (1985) notes that while very few studies have been carried out on this aspect of white-collar crime, the literature has revealed a range of motivations, which are often interlinked (see for instance Alalehto, 2003; Friedrichs, 1996; Holtfreter, 2005; Paternoster and Simpson, 1993; Shover and Hochstetler, 2006). Levi (2008) develops a typology which distinguishes between three types of fraudsters: ‘pre-planners’, those who start by constructing a plan to commit their crime; ‘intermediate planners’, who turn from honesty to fraud because of various experiences they have encountered; and ‘slippery-slope’ fraudsters, who (usually through reckless behaviour) incur debts which lead them into committing crime. During their interviews, offenders in the present study detailed a multitude of motivations and reasons, some of which overlapped, for their offending. They represented themselves as ‘actors’ in different situations to explain their deviant behaviour (in a similar way to that postulated in Levi’s typology). Individuals gave accounts describing both primary and secondary motivations, which covered a number of often multiple reasons and pressures. When these accounts were analysed, individuals presented themselves in one of three main ways — as ‘rational’, ‘pressurised’ or ‘seduced’ actors.', 'title': 'Motivation, Opportunity and Rationality'}\n",

Unfortunately, online gaming crime has turned out one of the most serious cybercrimes in many countries, such as in Taiwan, South Korea, China, and so on. In order to solve this judicial problem and effectively protect virtual property, we propose a Virtual Property Description Language (VPDL) as the syntax to record and express virtual property. There are six models, including Identity Model, Ownership Model, Trading Model, Content Model, Revocation Model, and Security Model. It can effectively protect virtual property and strengthen the competence of digital evidence by recording the legal source, ownership, trading track, and handling of virtual properties so as to lower the cases of online gaming crime. The online gaming companies may use it in the aspects of virtual property management, tracing historic records and collecting legal digital evidence, while the existing system mechanism of online game doesn’t need to be changed.', 'title': 'Preservation of Evidence in Case of Online Gaming Crime'}\n",

Such an ethics can aid in addressing the present malaise of the online community especially problems confronting human relations/interactions established therein. I shall argue for such claim in three steps. First, I shall establish that indeed the online world/online realm can be treated or viewed as a community, hence, an online community.

We discuss known ways we give off vital personal information while online in social networks. We further discuss ways to protect personal privacy.

But the mechanisms are not yet defined, and where they are being defined, it is still too early to say whether they are effective. The complexity, unpredictability, and lack of central authority is further enhanced by a virtual personality, anonymity and multiple personality.

Many of its challenges are similar to those experienced by other Latin American nations: social inequality, stagnant economic development, and armed insurgency. In 2000, Peru seemed to be headed for another common Latin American malady—autocratic or military rule. Faced with increasing criticism of his regime, President Alberto Fujimori seemed poised to preempt Peru’s democratic government. Yet, at this critical juncture, public outcry, mostly from within Peru itself, forced Fujimori into exile in Japan and restored democratic governance. During this tumultuous period, the Internet, although still at a nascent stage of development within Peru, played an intriguing role in allowing liberal democratic values to come to the forefront.

However, scant research has evaluated whether direct communications about legal risk can cause sanction perception updating, the updating of ambiguity in sanction perceptions, or changes in persons’ willingness to offend. No prior studies have evaluated sanction perception updating for white-collar crimes.MethodsTo address this research void, the current study analyzes data from an experiment embedded in a recent national survey (N\\u2009=\\u2009878). Multivariate regression models estimate the effect of providing participants with information about the “objective” arrest risk for white-collar offenses on their sanction perceptions.ResultsThe findings provide the first evidence that such information, when it is inconsistent with individuals’ prior beliefs, causes them to update: (1) their perceptions of the certainty of arrest; (2) their ambiguity about arrest risk; and, indirectly, (3) their willingness to commit white-collar crimes.ConclusionsThe results imply that individuals are willing to incorporate relevant information into their subjective beliefs about sanction risks. Importantly, however, they also make meaningful distinctions about the value of new information for understanding criminal risks.', 'title': 'Consequences of legal risk communication for sanction perception updating and white-collar criminality'}\n",

The term ‘fraud’ has different connotations and ranges from deception to dishonesty and includes corruption and conspiracy to embezzle money forcing the Sovereigns to have adequate AML risk assessment framework in addition to existing legislative and regulatory framework to mitigate business risks of fraud. A 2018 global study by Association of Certified Fraud Examiners on occupational frauds evidences $7 billion losses with 89% through asset misappropriation schemes resulting in a median loss of $114,000 and financial fraud scheme though accounting for 10%, evidenced $800,000 as the median loss. This remains the tip of the iceberg with many of the victims tending to underplay existence of the fraud to curb the reputational risk. A typical risk mitigation strategy towards fraud prevention revolves around building up framework to assess the vulnerability of systems, processes and people to raise red flags for fraud detection, prevention, cessation and response system and building up adequate internal and external controls as part of enhanced governance ecosystem. The global jurisprudence around the white-collar crimes is evolving. The developed countries have brought in suite of legislations; the regulators of securities and financial markets along with accounting/auditing profession domestically and internationally is developing standards and guidelines for compliance and related capacity building. In India, the Companies Act, 2013 has provided more teeth for fraud prevention and control for an enhanced governance ecosystem.

While prior studies have come to mixed conclusions, I provide new, more robust evidence based on a case study of extended Internet voting trials in Geneva canton, Switzerland. The trials almost exclusively involved referendum votes. For causal identification I exploit the unique circumstance that federal safety legislation created a near-natural experiment, with some of the canton’s municipalities participating in the trials and others not. Using difference-in-differences estimation, I find that the residual vote rate decreased by an average of 0.3 percentage points if municipalities offered the possibility to vote online in addition to (mostly optically scanned) paper ballots. For cantonal measures, which are located towards the bottom of ballot papers in Geneva, the reduction increases to 0.5 percentage points. These remain relatively modest effects, and I find no evidence for a knock-on effect on electoral outcomes. However, on average only around 20% of votes were cast online where the opportunity existed, and online voting was most popular among voters with high levels of education. Despite the small effect sizes, the results of this study therefore point to the potential of Internet and, more generally, electronic voting technology to reduce avoidable voter mistakes.', 'title': 'Making Votes Count with Internet Voting'}\n",

However a CSP-level scan faces an enormous challenge: hundreds of millions of apps are installed everyday; retaining their download traffic to construct their packages entails a huge burden on the CSP side, forces them to change their infrastructure and can have serious privacy and legal ramifications. To control the cost and avoid trouble, today’s CSPs acquire apps from download URLs for a malware analysis. Even this step is extremely expensive and hard to meet the demand of online protection: for example, a CSP we are working with runs hundreds of machines to check the daily downloads it observes. To rise up to this challenge, we present in this paper an innovative “app baleen” (called Abaleen) framework for an on-line security vetting of an extremely large number of app downloads, through a high-performance, concurrent inspection of app content from the sources of the downloads. At the center of the framework is the idea of retrieving only a small amount of the content from the remote sources to identify suspicious app downloads and warn the end users, hopefully before the installation is complete. Running on 90 million download URLs recorded by our CSP partner, our screening framework achieves an unparalleled performance, with a nearly 85\\\\(\\\\times \\\\) speed-up compared to the existing solution. This level of performance enables an online vetting for PHAs at the CSP scale: among all unique URLs used in our study, more than 95% were processed before the completion of unfettered downloads. With the CSP-level dataset, we revealed not only the surprising pervasiveness of PHAs, but also the real impact of them (over 2 million installs in merely 3 days).', 'title': 'Filtering for Malice Through the Data Ocean: Large-Scale PHA Install Detection at the Communication Service Provider Level'}\n",

In particular, they have changed the way we communicate and do our work, and in general our social behaviour. Organizations are more and more dependent on information managed and exchanged through digital technologies; Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligent (AI) applications continue to grow, producing a significant impact on our lives, and creating novel ethical and social issues to be faced. Not only common people and organizations use them, but also criminals exploit the advantages of technologies to enhance their modus operandi; while continuing to use traditional techniques, they are developing new expertise. The current landscape shows how cyberthreats continue to grow to the point where cyberattacks are included among the major risks to be concerned about for the next decade. Institutions and companies are improving their capabilities to strengthen cyber resilience, but results are far from being effective. In discussing what is possible to do to handle cybersecurity properly, we need—above all—to understand the relationship between people and technology, because people have to be considered as an essential part of any cybersecurity strategy. The serious impacts of cybercrime and the growth of cyberthreats have launched the theme of cybersecurity as a priority for nations, public institutions and private companies, with the aim of protecting their tangible and intangible assets.

This paper proposes to fine-tune this conventional moral assessment by arguing that some forms of cheating can be justified—or at least excused. To do so, it starts with a value-free definition of cheating that covers a wide diversity of situations: “breaking the rules while deliberately leading or allowing others to think they have been respected.” While using this definition at the metaethical level, the paper contends that the moral assessment of cheating depends on the obligation to comply with the rules. There are rules which do not entail moral obligations, and there are special circumstances where other more important obligations override the obligation to comply with the rules. Furthermore, the paper argues that respecting the penalty rules also influences the moral assessment of cheating on the rules. The key interest of this endeavor lies in contributing to building a more solid theoretical framework for the study of cheating in management, which may replace our common prejudices and basic intuitions on this matter.', 'title': 'Cheating in Business: A Metaethical Perspective'}\n",

The difference between the two is embedded in the understanding of governance itself. While the origin of governance goes deep into the constitutional and political framework of the country, e-governance originates in a technological regime formulated and controlled by the mega information technology labs in the USA and which would continue to control its anatomy at least for many years to come. Therefore, the greatest caution in adopting e-governance is to prevent policymakers from sinking into technological determinism and building up a system of decentralised management, control and information data storage capacity. e-Governance is possible because of the ICT or Internet technology. Looking into the nature and origin of the Internet, one gets an idea that this technology is rooted into a number of other subsidiary technologies which demonstrate a decentralising tendency of the Internet which e-governance needs to imbibe and reinvent itself accordingly. This chapter has highlighted the enormous potential of e-governance in poverty reduction and improving well-being of people as it overcomes distance and time besides making the society more interactive. However, this is possible only when nations are more forthcoming to collaborate, form partnerships and seek mutual sharing of successful practices as mentioned in the MDG 8 both within their country as well as with other countries in the neighbourhood. A large number of e-governance projects have been failing, bringing a huge loss to public exchequer and the taxpayers’ money. The government is expected to make efforts to fulfil preconditions of e-governance implementation, the most important of which is to implement inclusive governance reforms. As in India where the laboriously prepared 15 Administrative Commission Reforms Reports are accumulating dust so has been the experience with many Asian countries.

After the fifth EU Enlargement in 2007, transnational mobility has become a significant challenge for all western governments. As full EU citizens, large Roma populations now enjoy freedom of movement in Europe. The long standing prejudiced perception of Roma as profiteers unwilling to integrate became a basis for concerns about a “threatening flood” of Roma westward. As a result, several old Member States have introduced different control strategies allegedly to ensure security, legitimating excessive policing and surveillance of migrants in order to isolate them from national consensus. The “mechanisms” applied for sorting and excluding unwanted Roma communities are grounded in a set of punitive rules enacted through national and local legislation with the purpose of expulsion. Accordingly, limiting access to social services gradually replaced migration policies as a new process of selection regarding undesired European migrants from A8 countries. Service providers in the neoliberal bureaucratic social fields introduced new modalities of surveillance and restrictions to deny income assistance, benefit entitlement and legal aid. This chapter provides an empirical analysis on the effects of these sorting measures and on how the targeted groups either comply or circumnavigate these regulations in London.', 'title': 'Identity Game for Welfare: Circumventing Surveillance of Legal Migrants in Europe'}\n",

Additionally, terms limits generally have not worked as advocates had hoped and instead of weakening the power of veteran legislators, they have strengthened the influence of lobbyists and not done much to reduce political gridlock or change politics.', 'title': 'Democracy Is the Worst Form of Government'}\n",

While research in science education often reports on how individual reasoning changes when bringing SSI into the classroom, we argue for the relevance of analyzing how the individual is “in dialogue” with present as well as remote interlocutors and contexts on the internet. We suggest that the analytical approach is particularly sensitized to illuminate how students’ handle multiple perspectives. A dialogical perspective takes as its premise that SSI are part of society, where politicians, interest groups, and scientists engage in debates and offer perspectives that are often in conflict. Rather than assuming that the individual student is the primary unit for analysis, a dialogical approach is premised on an analysis that incorporates several perspectives and voices—a multivocality that also resides with the individual. Arguing for the relevance of this analytical approach to studies of SSI in the classroom, we analyze a group of students in upper secondary school as they discuss hydraulic fracturing after having worked with online data. The results illuminate how students discursively manage multivocality and multimodality inherent in the following SSI online. We describe a set of discursive means that the students use to handle the many perspectives involved when communicating about the issue. In addition, we describe and articulate what kind of communicative competences that are involved and, hence, could be cultivated through education, when engaging in public debates.', 'title': 'Navigating the Complexity of Socio-scientific Controversies—How Students Make Multiple Voices Present in Discourse'}\n",

Such behaviour threatens not only individual freedoms but also democracy, with female politicians increasingly exposed to vile threats and abuse. The chapter explores the persistence and reproduction of a victim-blaming rhetoric and the response of feminist activism to challenge online abuse through utilising online campaigns. It argues that whilst prevention is key to reducing the escalating harms caused by cyber abuse, it requires a strategy that moves beyond victim blaming to one that holds accountable not only the individual offenders but also internet giants.

But there is a significant residue of legal, moral and political difficulty: legislation against organized crime is hard to make effective; the harm of organized crime is not uniform, and so some preventive legislation seems too sweeping and potentially unjust. More fundamentally, the scale and rewards of organized crime are often dependent on mass public participation in markets for proscribed goods, which may point to a hidden public consensus in favour of some of what is criminalized.

Due to this, it is important to understand the nature and extent of the problem in detail so that novel identity management systems may be developed and eventually accepted. The focus of current exploratory research is to understand the spread and consequences of identity theft and fraud in Europe. A census representative on-line survey was carried out in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and, for comparative purposes, in the United States of America. The research found that 25–30% of the adult population in the surveys countries experienced some form of misuse or attempted misuse of their personal information within the past three years. Extrapolating from the initial results, it is expected that around 100 million European citizens have dealt or experienced misuse of their personal information within the last 3 years and close to 40 million EU citizens had, because of the misuse of their personal information, incurred significant personal consequences ranging from debt collection to legal problems. Government issued electronic identity cards for on-line transactions are needed for electronic authentication and signatures, and their use in the private and public sector should become more widespread. Mobile ID can also service as a convenient and secure alternative to more traditional electronic identity cards.', 'title': 'Risks and Societal Implications of Identity Theft'}\n",

Hiding of financial losses through fraud or manipulation in reporting, hence, resulted in the erosion of considerable wealth of their stakeholders. In fact, a number of global companies like WorldCom, Xerox, and Enron and a number of Indian companies such as Satyam, Kingfisher, and Deccan Chronicle had committed fraud in financial statement by manipulation. Hence, it is imperative to create an efficient and effective framework for detection of financial fraud. This can be helpful to regulators, investors, governments, and auditors as preventive steps in avoiding any possible financial fraud cases. In this context, increasing number of researchers these days have started focusing on developing systems, models, and practices to detect fraud in early stage to avoid any attrition of investor’s wealth and to reduce the risk of financing. In the current study, the researcher has attempted to explore the various 42 modeling techniques to detect Fraudulent Financial Statements (FFS). To perform the experiment, researcher has chosen 86 FFS and 92 non-Fraudulent Financial Statements (non-FFS) of manufacturing firms. The data were taken from Bombay Stock Exchange for the dimension of 2008–2011. Auditor’s report is considered for classification of FFS and non-FFS companies. T-test was applied to 31 important financial ratios, and 10 significant variables were taken into consideration for data mining techniques. 86 FFS and 92 non-FFS during 2008–2017 were taken for testing dataset. Researcher has trained the model using datasets. Then, the trained model was applied to the testing dataset for the accuracy check. Random forest gives the best accuracy.

We also consider future research that could improve both detectability, prevention, and response. This chapter seeks to cope with insider misuse in a broad range of application domains— for example, critical infrastructures, privacy-preserving database systems, financial systems, and interoperable health-care infrastructures. To illustrate this, we apply the principles considered here to the task of detecting and preventing insider misuse in systems that might be used to facilitate trustworthy elections. This discussion includes an examination of the relevance of the Saltzer-Schroeder-Kaashoek security principles and the Clark-Wilson integrity properties for end-to-end election integrity. Trustworthy system developments must consider insider misuse as merely one set of threats that must be addressed consistently together with many other threats such as penetrations, denials of service, system faults and failures, and other threats to survivability. In addition, insider misuse cannot be realistically addressed unless significant improvements are made in the trustworthiness of component systems and their networking as well as their predictably trustworthy compositions into enterprise solutions— architecturally, developmentally, and operationally.', 'title': 'Combatting Insider Threats'}\n",

Interestingly, the crime is registered against identity theft under Section 66-C under IT Act 2000–2008, whereas the complaint was against sedition crime. The culprit website of JNTUHJAC organization under CGoT was operational in the JNTUH University before the enactment of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014. Through the culprit website, approximately 2000 registrations were obtained for the organizations. A snapshot of the culprit website obtained through a web crawler tool was submitted to the police to substantiate evidence. We present, in the case study, the many facets of the moot cybercrime issues related to the JNTUH University academic environment and how they are handled. The crime is on account of the abusive usage of an image in the home page of the aforementioned website. The image usage is nationally abusive during 2011–14 because of the mention of “Government of Telangana,” whereas there was no such government formed by any constitutional provision such as enactment through parliament. The analysis of the image impresses us immediately about the seditiously organized group of pupils by the JNTUHJAC, an unregistered outfit in the JNTUH academic environment.

The basis of modern privacy laws and practices around the world, informational privacy has become a challenging concept to protect and promote in a world of ubiquitous and unlimited data sharing and storage among organizations. The paper advocates a “user-centric” approach to managing personal data online. However, user-centricity can be problematic when the user—the data subject—is not directly involved in transactions involving the disclosure, collection, processing, and storage of their personal data. Identity data is increasingly being generated, used and stored entirely in the networked “Cloud”, where it is under control of third parties. The paper explores possible technology solutions to ensure that individuals will be able to exercise informational self-determination in an era of network grid computing, exponential data creation, ubiquitous surveillance and rampant online fraud. The paper describes typical “Web 2.0” use scenarios, suggests some technology building blocks to protect and promote informational privacy online, and concludes with a call to develop a privacy-respective information technology ecosystem for identity management. Specifically, the paper outlines four fundamental technological approaches to help assure widespread and enduring online participation, confidence and trust in the information society.', 'title': 'Privacy in the clouds'}\n",

Called tongqi (同妻) these women often have unknowingly entered into such marriages, with their dreams of a happily family life crushed. For many gay men, these marriages become a useful camouflage that protect them from social pressure and discrimination. While sustaining their heterosexual marriages, they also maintain relationships with gay partners. The women, on the other hand, live tortured lives. They are filled with anger and feel they have been cheated and trapped in their marriages. They are also frightened of the social stigma that they might have contracted HIV from their husbands. With the proliferation of ICTs, especially smartphones, in China, the tongqis are now increasingly afforded the ability to form cybercommunities, which serve as both their social network as well as their political network. This chapter examines the posts and comments of tongqis on open online platforms such as Tianya Luntan and Tongqi Ba. Using this data set, I argue that ICTs, particularly in mobile platforms, allow tongqis to find and build community as well as to educate the public and advocate for social and political change.

We conducted an online survey of active Internet users and examined the associations between the two types of web trust and several independent factors: information technology competence, adverse online events, and general dispositions to be trusting or cautious of others. Using a series of nested ordered logistic regression models, we find positive associations between general trust, general caution, and the two types of web trust. The positive effect of information technology competence erases the effect of general caution for general website trust but not for familiar website trust, providing evidence that general trust and self-reported competence are stronger associates of general website trust than broad attitudes about prudence.

Online ticket queues, communities of online gamers, online retail malls and checkout sites, Facebook or MySpace communities, web-based town hall discussions, and Second Life destinations are just a few examples of places that users have come to regard as neighborhoods. They are virtual neighborhoods. They begin as attractive destinations and attract both visitors and inhabitants. Some users spend money, and some put down roots in the community. But like many real neighborhoods, virtual neighborhoods all too often turn into frightening, crime-ridden, disease- (or malware-)infested eyesores. Most users are driven away, real commerce is replaced by questionable transactions and billions of dollars of value is destroyed in the process. In blighted inner city neighborhoods you can find a familiar array of bad actors: loan sharks, vagrants, drug dealers, vandals and scam artists. Online neighborhoods fall prey to virtual blight: (1) Bot Blight, where the bad actors use bots and other non-human agents to overwhelm systems that are designed for human beings, (2) Human Blight, where individuals ranging from hackers to sociopaths and organized groups deliberately degrade a virtual neighborhood, (3) Entropy Blight, where abandoned property accumulates dead-end traffic of various kinds. The simple first-generation tools that were deployed to protect online properties have failed – the collapse of Geocities and the recent apparent defeat of Captcha, a technology to let only humans enter the neighborhood, are evidence of that failure. There is a growing realization of how easily bad actors can create the virtual version of urban blight and how ineffective existing approaches to identity, trust and security will be in battling it.', 'title': 'Blighted Virtual Neighborhoods and Other Threats to Online Social Experiences'}\n",

Discriminant analysis revealed two profiles which explained the most variance in gambling behavior; the first profile that corresponded to more explained variance was the student with higher psychopathology, less prosocial behavior, higher Internet addiction score with higher frequencies of online activities and moderate levels of truancy and lower expectation of school achievement. The second profile was that of a student who reported less psychopathology, more prosocial behavior, less involvement with the Internet in general but skipped classes more and his prospects on finishing high school were even slimmer.

We then apply these graph construction and analysis algorithms to study the general threat landscape, as well as four cases of sophisticated criminal networks. Our results indicate that in many cases, criminal networks can be taken down by de-registering as few as five domain names, removing critical communication links. In cases of sophisticated criminal networks, we show that our analysis techniques can identify hosts that are critical to the network’s functionality and estimate the impact of performing network takedowns in remediating the threats. In one case, disabling 20% of a criminal network’s hosts would reduce the overall volume of successful DNS lookups to the criminal network by as much as 70%.

The primary outcome is change in depressive symptoms after the intervention period, as measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Satisfaction with the program, usability, changes in perceived quality of life, and possible negative effects are assessed as secondary outcomes.DiscussionThis study represents the first randomized controlled trial on the iFightDepression® self-management tool in its German version, aiming at efficacy, but also at providing new insights into so far understudied aspects of E-mental health programs, namely the specificity of the treatment effect compared to an active control condition, it’s continuity over a time course of 12\\u2009months, and possible negative effects of these internet based interventions.Trial registrationInternational trial-registration took place through the “international clinical trials registry platform” (WHO) with the secondary ID 080–15-09032015.

Finally, several activation functions are applied to the model to verify its efficiency in several scenarios.

Wing': ['Carnegie Mellon University', 'USA']}, 'date': '2011-03-28', 'abstract': 'We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games [3,10,11], norms-establishing contracts [1], and scams [6,35,33]. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants [11,10]. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced whenever protocol noncompliance leads to punishment of untrustworthy participants [11,23]; i.e., it seems natural that betrayal aversion can be decreased and belief in trustworthiness increased by properly defined punishment [1]. We argue that a general theory of trust should focus on the establishment of new trust relations where none were possible before. This focus would help create new economic opportunities by increasing the pool of usable services, removing cooperation barriers among users, and at the very least, taking advantage of “network effects.” Hence a new theory of trust would also help focus security research in areas that promote trust-enhancement infrastructures in human and computer networks. Finally, we argue that a general theory of trust should mirror, to the largest possible extent, human expectations and mental models of trust without relying on false methaphors and analogies with the physical world.', 'title': 'Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers'}\n",

The issues related to climate change and global warming have surpassed shocking levels to the extent that it is being discussed in major forums on a frequent basis. Most recently a summit organised in Paris, United Nations conference on climate change (COP21), aims to address these issues. More than 150 Heads of States and Governments are due to participate in this conference, making it one of the largest diplomatic conferences ever organised, aside from the United Nations General Assembly sessions. Literature review shows us that many steps have been taken in order to address these issues, however, as we are reminded by Albert Einstein “…it is important to avoid doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”. Pakistan, being a developing country, is at a cross-road as a wide range of issues bear down upon it. Maintaining sustainability and stabilising the sustainability agenda is not one of the primary focus for its government. As it is known that poverty and sustainability go hand-in-hand, Pakistan must first adhere to the agenda of the Rio Convention of 1992 for eradication of poverty in order to increase the production and sustainability so that the needs of the majority of people can be met. Pakistan currently stands at number 8 on the list of 10 countries that will bear the worst implications of climate change. It is estimated that current pledges to cut carbon emissions will cost developing countries 50% more in the near future as compared to previous years. Higher education around the world is of prime focus as the forces of change present various challenges. These challenges are multifaceted, interconnected and are reinforced by social, economic, cultural and environmental developments. This setting puts higher education in a leadership role which calls for development of future leaders who are fully equipped to handle these challenges effectively.', 'title': 'Examining the Opportunities and Risks Associated with Sustainability Awareness in Higher Education in Pakistan'}\n",

Until now, these models, however, did not furnished much insights into the continuous way that ions could follow from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu in the open form of the channel. Here, we have built a refined model of CFTR, based on the outward-facing Sav1866 experimental 3D structure and integrating the evolutionary and structural information available today. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant conformational changes, resulting in a full-open channel, accessible from the cytosol through lateral tunnels displayed in the long intracellular loops (ICLs). At the same time, the region of nucleotide-binding domain 1 in contact with one of the ICLs and carrying amino acid F508, the deletion of which is the most common CF-causing mutation, was found to adopt an alternative but stable position. Then, in a second step, this first stable full-open conformation evolved toward another stable state, in which only a limited displacement of the upper part of the transmembrane helices leads to a closure of the channel, in a conformation very close to that adopted by the Atm1 ABC exporter, in an inward-facing conformation. These models, supported by experimental data, provide significant new insights into the CFTR structure–function relationships and into the possible impact of CF-causing mutations.', 'title': 'Full-open and closed CFTR channels, with lateral tunnels from the cytoplasm and an alternative position of the F508 region, as revealed by molecular dynamics'}\n",

To this end, an Internet survey and an in-depth interviews will be employed to investigate the unprecedented popularity of the Internet with people who are dissatisfied with the mainstream media (commercial newspapers, radio and television), which do not serve their need to have their voice heard in public. The study argues that due to (1) the media domination of political and business powers, (2) the lack of a public channel of communication and (3) the suppression of opposing viewpoints by the government, people utilise the Internet and the bulletin boards, in particular, as an alternative form of communication to express their concerns and engage in public affairs. The main argument of this paper is to dispel the notion that the Internet is a medium that is exclusively the purview of those who are affluent, who are privileged with resources, income or education. The predominant belief in Thailand today is that the Internet is there to serve the privileged and that this could lead to even more elitist control and censorship. Conversely, this investigation reveals that people as users can in fact make a difference; that is, to a large extent, they are capable of influencing the medium to be more supportive of them and their environment. As the Internet is capable of being a venue of popular usage, this paper argues that it is crucial to support this new medium’s penetration of a wider public. The problem of a digital divide needs to be addressed; large sections of population, especially those who lack either financial resources or technical skills, must be included in this Information and Communication Technologies development.', 'title': 'The Internet in Thailand: An Alternative Means of Communication'}\n",

STE can be defined as he complex interrelationships between people, information, processes and technology and online networks. It addresses issues that are central to the domains of online sextortion and the interactivities between tasks, information and social. The methods chosen for this research project to address the sextortion problems and online presence have been identified in the research and developed here to address the STE of online sextortion from a cybersecurity perspective using Checklands Soft System Methodology (SSM) and a modified version of the Event Analysis of Systemic Team-work (EAST) model to illustrate it. The results of this project discuss the impact of sextortion on our socio-technical environment, and then how and where, law enforcement, governments, NGOs and technology companies are tackling these online threats. This paper further investigates they could take to prevent online sextortion from happening, protecting potential victims and better risk managing this environment. The research suggests that any cybersecurity measures taken, need to be considered in a holistic light. To prevent online sextortion because through the STE shows that the platforms, services and wide-ranging geographic nature of the groups and individuals of the victims and perpetrators because no single measure could mitigate all the vulnerabilities that lead to the proliferation of sextortion.', 'title': 'The Analysis of the Socio-Technical Environment (STE) of Online Sextortion Using Case Studies and Published Reports from a Cybersecurity Perspective'}\n",

The approach complements analytical data mining techniques where the rules or definitions of what might constitute an exception are able to be known and specified ahead of time. For example, in the analysis of transaction data there are no known suspicious transactions. This chapter presents a human-centred visual data mining methodology that addresses the issues of depicting implicit relationships between data attributes and/or specific values of these attributes. Different aspects of the approach is demonstrated through the reflection of the analytical process in two cases: one looking at fraudulent activity which will be difficult, if not impossible to detect with conventional exception detection methods, and the other one looking at exploring a large data set of low level communication data.

Although most research has focused on patients with severe mental illness, depressed patients have been demonstrated to be prone to victimization as well. Victimization is associated with more severe symptomatology, decreased quality of life, and high risk of revictimization. Hence, there is a strong need for interventions that focus on preventing violent revictimization. Since emotion dysregulation is associated with both victimization and depression, we developed an internet-based Emotion Regulation Training (iERT) to reduce revictimization in depressed patients. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of iERT added to Treatment As Usual (TAU) in reducing incidents of violent revictimization among depressed patients with a recent history of victimization. Furthermore, this study aims to examine secondary clinical outcomes, and moderators and mediators that may be associated with treatment outcomes.MethodsIn a multicenter randomized controlled trial with parallel group design, patients with a major depressive disorder and a history of violent victimization over the past three years (N\\u2009=\\u2009200) will be allocated to either TAU + iERT (N\\u2009=\\u2009100) or TAU only (N\\u2009=\\u2009100), based on computer-generated stratified block randomization. Assessments will take place at baseline, 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 6 months after start of treatment, and 12, 24, and 36 months after baseline. The primary outcome measure is the total number of violent victimization incidents at 12 months after baseline, measured with the Safety Monitor: an adequate self-report questionnaire that assesses victimization over the preceding 12 months. Secondary outcome measures and mediators include emotion dysregulation and depressive symptomatology. An economic evaluation with the societal perspective will be performed alongside the trial.DiscussionThis study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at reducing violent revictimization in depressed patients. If effective, iERT can be implemented in mental health care, and contribute to the well-being of depressed patients. Furthermore, the results will provide insight into underlying mechanisms of revictimization.Trial registrationThe study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5822).

Because dietary supplements are used in the context of other health behaviors, they may have direct and indirect health benefits.

We examined use of dietary supplements among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and the association between use of dietary supplements and believing medical misinformation.MethodsA convenience sample of 268 men and 76 women living with HIV was recruited from AIDS services and clinics in Atlanta, GA. Participants completed measures of demographic and health characteristics, dietary supplement use, beliefs about dietary supplements, internet use, and an internet evaluation task designed to assess vulnerability to medical misinformation.ResultsOne out of four PLWH currently used at least one dietary supplement product excluding vitamins. Dietary supplement use was associated with higher education and greater use of the internet for health-related information. Dietary supplement users also endorsed greater believability and trust in unfounded claims for HIV cures.ConclusionsDietary supplement use is common among PLWH and is associated with a broad array of health information seeking behaviors.

Worse, more than 80 % of users gets in touch the first tracker within 1 second after starting navigating. And we see a lot of websites that hosts hundreds of tracking services. Conversely, those popular web extensions that may improve personal protection, e.g., DoNotTrackMe, are actually installed by a handful of users (3.5 %).

As economies become more and more information-driven, the issues of women's access to and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) are growing in importance for both developed and developing economies. Some claim that women are rather technophobic and that men are much better users of digital tools while others argue that women enthusiastically embrace digital communication.The ease with which information and communication technologies can transmit and disseminate information for development is well recognized. However, women's access to ICTs cannot be assumed to occur ‘naturally’ when gender-blind approaches and technologies are implemented. As a result of profound, gendered applications and implications of ICTs in employment, education, training, and other areas of life, women need encouragement and support to take their rightful place in the information revolution.Research has demonstrated that security and privacy in use of ICT, especially in the internet, are the most important thematic areas of gender concerns which include freedom of expression, privacy of communication, and secure online spaces where vulnerable groups such as women feel unsafe from harassment. The main concern that discourages women to enter dynamically into e-business market is the disclosure of their personal information compared with men who appear willing to be sacrificing their privacy at the altar of profit of electronic commerce.The aims of this research are the following: firstly, to present digital threats and risks facing women entrepreneurs daily while interacting with online communities, secondly, to study security gaps that the privacy policies of popular pages contain, and lastly, to give proof that women justifiably worry about their security and privacy when using online communities and virtual worlds, like the social networking sites.

Also in Finland there have been, during the very recent years, cases of match-manipulation in football. Match-manipulation is not a new phenomenon in Finland; at the turn of the millennium, some clubs in Finnish pesäpallo (a special type of baseball) faced allegations of betting-related match-manipulation. As a result of these allegations, twenty persons, all of them Finnish nationals, were sentenced for fraud in 2001. As a result of these very recent cases of match-manipulation in football in Finland sentences have been imposed for bribery in business. This research analyses match-manipulation in football. It aims to provide a deep and systematic analysis of the phenomena by discussing its magnitude, link to transnational organised criminality as well as the reasons and the motivations behind the phenomenon. The research identifies different modus operandi of match-manipulation, also highlighting the points of vulnerability. The emphasis of the research is on the prevention side and the focus is on Finland. The aim is on mapping and analysing the Finnish legal responses against match-manipulation, the Finnish criminal code 19.12.1889/39 and the relevant criminal case law are in the centre of the research. A short comparative part is presented to illustrate the Nordic perspective on combating the phenomenon.

In contrast, first generation users remain anchored to one or more personal computers in the household or workplace for accessing the Internet. The analysis shows how this emerging pattern of access is reshaping the use and impact of the Internet, such as in supporting the production of user generated content.

We consider the access that these conduits provide not only to other patients with MS but also to a wealth of disease-related information online. These themes are further illustrated with first-hand experiences of the patient author and her physician. We also explore the impact of the Internet and social media on the education and support of patients with MS from the healthcare professional’s (HCP’s) perspective, including opportunities for HCPs to promote disease education among their patients, and the advantages that arise from patients being better informed about their disease.

OSN users share their ideas, photos, daily life events, feelings and news. Since OSNs’ security and privacy challenges are more potential than ever before, it is necessary to enhance the protection and filtering approaches of OSNs contents. This paper explores OSNs’ threats and challenges, and categorize them into: account-based, URL-based and content-based threats. In addition, we analyze the existing protection methods and highlight their limitations and weaknesses. Based on that, we propose a comprehensive, user-level, proactive and real-time OSNs’ protection system, called Hybrid Real-time Social Networks Protector (HRSP). HRSP has three components; a user-level security protocol and two classification models. The protocol defines a structure for OSN’s cryptographic services, including encryption, access control and users’ authentication. The classification models employ machine learning, black lists, white lists and users’ feedback, in order to classify URLs into: Benign, Risk and Inappropriate classes, and contents into: Benign, Hate speech and Inappropriate classes. We constructed two data sets of 150,000 URLs and 22,000 tweets to build and test the two classification models. Results show an overall accuracy of 93.2% for the URL model and 84.4% for the content model, while the protocol implementation produces compatible size and time overhead. The components of HRSP are integrated and have compatible design with OSN platforms.', 'title': 'Hybrid Real-Time Protection System for Online Social Networks'}\n",

It highlights how responses that are based on conflict often prove counterproductive when applied to hacktivism, as an activity that itself flows from social conflict. The chapter then offers a theoretical and practical framework for responding to hacktivism that is based on more symbiotic rather than conflict-focused rationales and actions and suggests some ways symbiosis can be facilitated and promoted both from within, but also out with the criminal justice system. It attempts to highlight the need for better understanding and interplay between all stakeholders involved and the requirement for everyone to attempt to act in ways that could reduce conflict and backlash effects and thus manage to more fully achieve the goals of crime prevention, proportionality, and promotion of productive democratic deliberation. The chapter discusses responses relating to a reconsideration of the concepts of damage and loss and promoting technology-based, more relevant penalties when dealing with hacktivism. It also elaborates on the need for providing more inclusive processes and spaces for political deliberation and contestation to be realised in and the ways the negative effects of protests could be mitigated through technology. Finally, it discusses the role of hacktivists in promoting symbiotic solutions and their responsibility to provide well-thought-out arguments and strategies and to try to maintain the standards of ethical protesting within their spaces and communities.', 'title': 'Moving from Conflict to Symbiosis'}\n",

Its purpose is to examine variations in participation in gambling activities, including land-based and Internet gambling, and in measurement approaches to studying gambling-related problems.Recent FindingsBetween 15 and 80% of young people report past-year gambling participation, typically involving scratch cards, lotteries, card games and sports betting. Around 5% report past-year Internet gambling. Estimates of problem gambling among adolescents vary, with Australian figures generally between 1 and 5%, and studies in the USA, Canada, UK, Italy and Finland generally reporting rates of 1 to 7%. Simulated gambling involvement (e.g., gambling-like apps, social casino games) appears more prevalent but its relationship to monetary gambling and problem gambling risk requires further research.SummaryYouth gambling and exposure to gambling-like activities via digital technologies is a global phenomenon that warrants continuing research. Research is required at the conceptual level, for example, to identify relevant harms and map links to other risk behaviours, and at the methodological level to identify optimal measurement approaches. This includes considering respondents’ level of involvement in reported gambling (active vs passive), recall issues and clearly distinguishing monetary from simulated gambling. Understanding youth gambling is particularly relevant as new digital technology-based gambling activities and promotions become more prevalent and available to young people with the means to access them.', 'title': 'Adolescent Land-Based and Internet Gambling: Australian and International Prevalence Rates and Measurement Issues'}\n",

Contingent valuation (CV) is a common survey method used to elicit how much the public is willing to pay (WTP) to reduce a particular crime. We utilize one of the first datasets in criminal justice that includes open-ended WTP data gathered from a survey using factorial design and random assignment. WTP figures are then input into a formula which also takes into account 1) the number of households and 2) the number of crimes “avoided,” which is calculated based upon the percentage crime reduction presented to survey respondents. Drawing upon data from a representative sample of the United States, we assess how sensitive respondents are to crime type, crime reduction percentages, program types, and framing. Results demonstrate that in general, open-ended WTP surveys elicit highly skewed responses and that respondents are more willing to pay for crime reduction programs with a higher number of individual components. However, respondents are not sensitive to crime reductions or several other survey framing techniques. Importantly, due to these highly skewed WTP values and lack of responsivity to crime control percentages, final cost of crime numbers vary widely – potentially altering policy decisions driven by these methods. We conclude with a discussion of the appropriateness of these methods for accurately estimating the costs of crime.', 'title': 'The Influence of Scope, Frames, and Extreme Willingness to Pay Responses on Cost of Crime Estimates'}\n",

The previous five chapters provide an in-depth and detailed overview of the individual pieces of the puzzle, or rather the facilitating factors of financial identity theft. This chapter, in contrast, takes a step back to observe the entire puzzle, or the broad picture, in an effort to develop an opportunity structure. Ronald V. Clarke uses the notion of a crime opportunity structure to demonstrate the interdependent relationship between crime opportunity and a variety of societal aspects. These include socio-economic structure, including demographics and geography, as well as lifestyle/routine activity and physical environment. All of these aspects influence the core of the crime opportunity structure which contains the victims, targets, and facilitators. Since the opportunity structure takes a comprehensive approach to the social context of crime, its construction for financial identity theft must contain both the overarching features of all facilitating factors as well as an understanding of the underlying mechanisms which nurture them. This is precisely why the usage of the process tracing approach was appropriate to gain valuable background information about the underlying mechanisms which established the (potential) facilitating factors as well as the process of facilitation of financial identity theft itself.', 'title': 'From Piece to Puzzle'}\n",

Many protocols in the literature address one or two such threats, but no rigorous security models —nor clean proofs— exist so far.

This paper, based on the data collected from a high-profile case in China, aims to analyze the features of cyberbullying language that is targeted at adults on the social media. Data analysis shows that online users tend to choose particular forms of address to identify the victim and employ lexical and grammatical evaluative resources to negate the victim and conduct trial by social media. Through interactions among participants online and offline, the negative effects of cyberbullying may be achieved, realizing, ironically, the function of language, “to do things with words”.

Individuals who commit pornography offenses are at lower risk to commit contact offenses and their risk factors include having sexual interest in children and antisocial attitudes.SummaryOnline offenders are different from contact sexual offenders and from offenders who commit both types of offenses.

Based on this communication infrastructure, we define a social network and its subset, the online social network. We discuss the types of social networks, their historical development, and the different and changing services of online social networks. After discussing the basics of online social networks, we then focus on ethical, social, and privacy issues in the online social network noting that while online, we inevitably give off our information to whomever asks for it in order to get services. We note further that routinely information collected from online community members, however, is not always used as intended. It is quite often used for unauthorized purposes, hence an invasion of privacy. We discuss known ways we give off vital personal information while online in social networks. We further discuss ways to protect personal privacy. On the central point of ethical implications of life in the social network, we note that unlike in the traditional network, governance is not centralized, but community based with equally shared authority and responsibility by all users. But the mechanisms are not yet defined, and where they are being defined, it is still too early to say whether they are effective. The complexity, unpredictability, and lack of central authority are further enhanced by a the concepts of telepresence and immersion, virtual personality, anonymity, and multiple personality.

We discuss the challenges associated with measuring the success of counter-discourse, and how activists rely on combinations of social media analytics and anecdotal feedback in order to ascertain that their campaigns are successful. We also discuss the often hidden power-relationships in such campaigns, especially where there is ambiguity regarding the grassroots legitimacy of activism, and where effort is placed into controlling and owning the propagation of counter-discourse.

This paper goes beyond the prodigious commentary on the Act itself to understand the nature of its reception outside the USA. It first develops a hubs-and-spokes account of global corporate life in which corporate purpose (which varies around the world) forms the hub and radiates spokes constituting governance, finance, accounting and auditing — all of which also differ around the world. Using this model, the paper suggests that non-US receptions of the Act exhibited unfounded fear that the export of US norms concerning the spokes of corporate life could redefine corporate conceptions of the hub, corporate purpose. It also shows the fallacy in the ‘no scandal here’ argument emanating from countries around the world. Although global reactions to the Act may therefore have been somewhat overstated, the Act certainly carried a whiff of exporting US corporate norms around the world by fiat. A key lesson for the USA is that, the next time US corporate scandals erupt and Congress adopts a legislative response, it should automatically exempt non-US issuers pending Securities and Exchange Commission determination of the necessity of applying the reforms to them. A related implication of this model and interpretation concerns debate over whether corporate life around the world is converging to a single model or remaining path dependent and varied. Moves like SOX seem to change the character of both the debate and the direction of evolving corporate life.

Thus, states are establishing sovereign control in the virtual world in the name of security and economic sustainability. This paper analyses the emergence of what we call cybered territorial sovereignty as a consequence of states’ efforts to secure their borders against cyber attacks. The case of Stuxnet is introduced as an instance of new threat faced in the cyberspace. We argue Stuxnet marks the beginning of a new cyber Westphalian world of virtual borders and national cyber commands.

In this paper we use the machine learning and deep learning method to model and analyze the unstructured natural language text of P2P agencies, and we propose an interpretable machine learning method to evaluate the fraud risk of P2P agencies, which enhances the credibility of the AI model. First, this paper explains model behavior based on the psychological interpersonal fraud theory in the field of social science. At the same time, the NLP and influence function in the field of natural science are used to verify that the machine learning model really learns the information of part-of-speech details in the fraud theory, which provides the psychological interpretable support for the model of P2P risk evaluation. In addition, we propose “style vectors” to describe the overall differences between text styles of P2P agencies and understand model behavior. Experiments show that using style vectors and influence functions to describe text style differences is the same as human intuitive perception. This proves that the machine learning model indeed learn the text style difference and use it for risk evaluation, which further shows that the model has a certain machine learning interpretability.', 'title': 'Interpretable Machine Learning Based on Integration of NLP and Psychology in Peer-to-Peer Lending Risk Evaluation'}\n",

Second, an ethicalassessment is made of the defamatory speechenvironment in order to determine which actorshave moral responsibility for the harm causedby defamatory speech. This moral assessment iscompared to the developing and anticipatedlegal paradigm to identify possible conformityof moral and legal tenants or to recognize theconflict between morality and law in assigningresponsibility to defamatory actors. Thisassessment then concludes with possiblesuggestions for changes in the legal climategoverning the regulation of defamatory speechon the Internet, as well as prediction of theresult should the legal climate continue todevelop on its present course. This is not tosuggest that all law, or even the law ofdefamation, be structured to reflect thesubjectivity of a moral construct, but since itis the authors position that the legalassignment of liability in online settings ismisaligned, this reflection can serve asbeginning reassessment of that assignment.\", 'title': 'Sticks and stones and words that harm: Liability vs. responsibility, section 230 and defamatory speech in cyberspace'}\n",

From routine activities theory, increased visibility is associated with higher cyber-victimization and cyber-offending across many offenses. Integrating social learning and self-control concepts, research has found that effects of low self-control on cybercrime are mediated through association with deviant peers and beliefs that the behaviors are not morally wrong.

Internet Provider (IP) addresses, user names, and passwords were the most useful for identifying “infrequent” repeat responders. “Hackers” often varied their IP address and identifying information to prevent easy identification, but investigating the data for small variations in IP, using reverse telephone look up, and patterns across usernames and passwords were helpful. Incentives appeared to play a role in stimulating multiple submissions, especially from the more sophisticated “hackers”.

Contrary to what other studies have found, in this study, dishonest students were similarly or even more active with the courseware than the rest, and we hypothesize that these might be working groups taking the course seriously and solving exams together to achieve a higher grade. With MOOC-based degrees and SPOCs for credit becoming the norm in distance learning, we believe that if this issue is not tackled properly, it might endanger the future of the reliability and value of online learning credentials.', 'title': 'Identifying and characterizing students suspected of academic dishonesty in SPOCs for credit through learning analytics'}\n",

In such context, securing the access rights to some objects such as data, apparatus, and contents, is still a challenge. This paper introduces a risk-based authentication technique based on behavioral biometrics as solution approach to tackle this challenge. Risk-based authentication is an increasingly popular component in the security architecture deployed by many organizations to mitigate online identity fraud. Risk-based authentication uses contextual and historical information extracted from online communications to build a risk profile for the user that can be used accordingly to make authentication and authorization decisions. Existing risk-based authentication systems rely on basic web communication information such as the source IP address or the velocity of transactions performed by a specific account, or originating from a certain IP address. Such information can easily be spoofed, and as such, put in question the robustness and reliability of the proposed systems. In this paper, we propose a new online risk-based authentication system that provides more robust user identity information by combining mouse dynamics and keystroke dynamics biometrics in a multimodal framework. We propose a Bayesian network model for analyzing free keystrokes and free mouse movements involved in web sessions. Experimental evaluation of our proposed model with 24 participants yields an Equal Error Rate of 8.21 %. This is very encouraging considering that we are dealing with free text and free mouse movements, and the fact that many web sessions tend to be very short.', 'title': 'Online risk-based authentication using behavioral biometrics'}\n",

In this paper, we explore the security implications of this blurred boundary, both for the worker and the employer. Mobile workers may not always make optimal security-related choices when “on the go” and more impulsive individuals may be particularly affected as they are considered more vulnerable to distraction. In this study, we used a task scenario, in which 104 users were asked to choose a wireless network when responding to work demands while out of the office. Eye-tracking data was obtained from a subsample of 40 of these participants in order to explore the effects of impulsivity on attention. Our results suggest that impulsive people are more frequent users of public devices and networks in their day-to-day interactions and are more likely to access their social networks on a regular basis. However, they are also likely to make risky decisions when working on-the-go, processing fewer features before making those decisions. These results suggest that those with high impulsivity may make more use of the mobile Internet options for both work and private purposes, but they also show attentional behavior patterns that suggest they make less considered security-sensitive decisions. The findings are discussed in terms of designs that might support enhanced deliberation, both in the moment and also in relation to longer term behaviors that would contribute to a better work–life balance.', 'title': 'Exploring the relationship between impulsivity and decision-making on mobile devices'}\n",

Of the 150 theses, 75% contained significant plagiarism (>100 word equivalents) and 39%, very much (>500 word equivalents).

Respondents did not claim to be ‘bad online users’ despite their engagement in online DCB. Instead of the number and level of engagement in online DCB, it was the level of perceived wrongness of online DCB that was found to statistically significantly relate to the respondents’ self-assessment level of being a ‘bad online user’. Findings about respondents’ perceptions of various neutralisation techniques revealed that respondents use different neutralisation techniques for justifying and adopting different online DCB.

There has been little research on the financial aspects of wildlife trafficking, despite how useful financial laws could be to prosecute traffickers in countries where environmental laws are weak. This research uses the crime script model and Gottschalk’s (Journal of Financial Crime, 17(4), 441–458, 2010) financial crime classification to study the financial crimes committed by wildlife traffickers during the trafficking process. Results show that financial crimes, including corruption, fraud, and money laundering, are part of every stage of the trafficking process for every actor involved.

This provides a promising opportunity for balancing the smart grid of the future, because vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems can utilize the batteries of plugged-in EVs as much needed distributed energy storage: In times of high production and low demand the excess energy in the grid is stored in the EVs’ batteries, while peaks in demand are mitigated by EVs feeding electricity back to the grid. But the data needed for managing individual V2G charging sessions as well as for billing and rewards is of a highly personal and therefore sensitive nature. This causes V2G systems to pose a significant threat to the privacy of their users. Existing cryptographic protocols for this scenario either do not offer adequate privacy protection or fail to provide key features necessary to obtain a practical system.Based on the recent cryptographic toll collection framework P4TC, this work introduces a privacy-preserving but efficient V2G payment and reward system called P6V2G. Our system facilitates two-way transactions in a semi online and post-payment setting. It provides double-spending detection, an integrated reputation system, contingency traceability and blacklisting features, and is portable between EVs. The aforementioned properties are holistically captured within an established cryptographic security framework.

They are firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus systems, honeypots etc. Despite employing these detection measures and protection mechanisms, the number of successful attacks and the level of sophistication of these attacks keep increasing day-by-day. Also, with the advent of Internet-of-Things, the number of devices connected to Internet has risen dramatically. The inability to detect attacks on these devices are due to (1) the lack of computational power for detecting attacks, (2) the lack of interfaces that could potentially indicate a compromise on this devices and (3) the lack of the ability to interact with the system to execute diagnostic tools. This warrants newer approaches such as Tier-1 Internet Service Provider level view of attack patterns to provide situational awareness of Cyber Security threats. We investigate and explore the event data generated by the Internet protocol Domain Name Systems (DNS) for the purpose of Cyber threat situational awareness. Traditional methods such as Static and Binary analysis of Malware are sometimes inadequate to address the proliferation of Malware due to the time taken to obtain and process the individual binaries in order to generate signatures. By the time the Anti-Malware signature is available, there is a chance that a significant amount of damage might have happened. The traditional Anti-Malware systems may not identify malicious activities. However, it may be detected faster through DNS protocol by analyzing the generated event data in a timely manner. As DNS was not designed with security in mind (or suffers from vulnerabilities), we explore how the vast amount of event data generated by these systems can be leveraged to create Cyber threat situational awareness. The main contributions of the book chapter are two-fold: (1). A scalable framework that can perform web scale analysis in near real-time that provide situational awareness. (2). Detect early warning signals before large scale attacks or malware propagation occurs. We employ deep learning approach to classify and correlate malicious events that are perceived from the protocol usage. To our knowledge this is the first time, a framework that can analyze and correlate the DNS usage information at continent scale or multiple Tier-1 Internet Service Provider scale has been studied and analyzed in real-time to provide situational awareness. Merely using a commodity hardware server, the developed framework is capable of analyzing more than 2 Million events per second and it could detect the malicious activities within them in near real-time. The developed framework can be scaled out to analyze even larger volumes of network event data by adding additional computing resources. The scalability and real-time detection of malicious activities from early warning signals makes the developed framework stand out from any system of similar kind.', 'title': 'Scalable Framework for Cyber Threat Situational Awareness Based on Domain Name Systems Data Analysis'}\n",

The use of private browsing is a common challenge faced in, for example, child exploitation investigations, which usually originate on the Internet. Although private browsing features are not designed specifically for criminal activity, they have become a valuable tool for criminals looking to conceal their online activity. Private browsing features and browsers often require a more in-depth, post-mortem analysis. This often requires the use of multiple tools, as well as different forensic approaches to uncover incriminating evidence. This evidence may be required in a court of law, where analysts are often challenged both on their findings and on the tools and approaches used to recover evidence.

However, recent prevalence surveys have shown greater numbers of females are now gambling. Much of the gambling literature suggests online gamblers are more likely to be male, and that problem gamblers are more likely to be male. Males and females are also likely to be gambling for different reasons and have a preference for different gambling activities. Little is known about the pattern of play among female online gamblers. The aim of this survey was to develop a better profile of female online gamblers and to examine any gender differences between males and females in terms of how and why they gamble online, their frequency of online gambling, patterns of play, as well as attitudes to online gambling. The survey was posted on 32 international online gambling websites and was completed by 975 online gamblers (including 175 female online gamblers). Chi-square tests of association were conducted to examine the association between gender and a range of variables. The results showed that females had been gambling online for a shorter duration of time than males, had much shorter online gambling sessions, different motivations for gambling online (i.e., to practice for free, to spend less money and out of boredom), and experienced online gambling differently to males, with increased feelings of guilt and shame for gambling online. This suggests there is still a stigma around gambling particularly evident among females in this study. The findings indicate that clinicians and treatment providers need to be aware of these potential gender differences in online gambling to develop appropriately tailored interventions.', 'title': 'An Empirical Study of Gender Differences in Online Gambling'}\n",

Based on the research, many of the sex-related crimes under Philippine law can be used to investigate and prosecute the sexual abuse and exploitation of real children and minors via webcam or other similar means or media. However, most of these crimes do not apply in the case of Sweetie 2.0 because they require as an essential element for their commission the involvement of a real child or minor victim. As such, the possible crimes that may be committed in relation to Sweetie 2.0 are limited to cybersex, attempted cybersex, grooming, and luring. Also, since the general rule is that criminal investigations can only conducted when a crime has been, is being or is about to be committed, Sweetie 2.0 can only be used in the first stance to investigate these four offenses.', 'title': 'Substantive and Procedural Legislation in the Philippines to Combat Webcam-Related Child Sexual Abuse'}\n",

We report on the representativeness of a post election mixed-mode (Internet and mail) survey design of 2006 general election voters.

The results show that both trust in borrowers and trust in intermediaries are significant factors influencing lenders’ lending intention. However, trust in borrowers is more critical, and not only directly nurtures lenders’ lending intention more efficiently than trust in intermediaries, but also carries the impact of trust in intermediaries on lenders’ lending intention. To develop lenders’ trust, borrowers should provide high-quality information for their loan requests and intermediaries should provide high-quality services and sufficient security protection.

Understanding local perceptions of the vaccine is necessary, as they could inform future educational programmes. Given that social media provide new opportunities to communicate about vaccination, this paper sought to explore the public’s constructions of the HPV vaccine as they were expressed on Internet discussion forums.MethodsTwenty discussion forums, with a total sample size of 2,240 comments (2007–2012), were included. We conducted a thematic analysis with a focus on language, informed by a discourse analytic approach.ResultsPositive discourses relying on evidence-based arguments or cancer-related experiences battled with negative discourses that focused mostly on pseudo-scientific information and affect-based testimonials. Both camps made use of appeals to authority in order to provide powerful messages. Critics expressed high levels of mistrust in the health system and perceived the vaccine as dangerous, as part of a conspiracy, as unnecessary or as a promoter of promiscuity. By contrast, supporters considered the HPV vaccine to be helpful and criticized the irrationality of opponents. Ambivalence and uncertainty also emerged, along with criticism toward the suboptimal organization of the vaccination programmes. Findings highlight ways in which views about the vaccine are embedded in broader perspectives about science, the national medical system, society development and economic inequality.ConclusionOnline posts are likely to elicit fear and doubts around vaccination, which in turn may impair decisions.

Cyber criminals exploit this spur in user engagement levels to spread malicious content that compromises system reputation, causes financial losses and degrades user experience. In this paper, we collect and characterize a dataset of 4.4 million public posts generated on Facebook during 17 news-making events (natural calamities, sports, terror attacks, etc.) over a 16-month time period. From this dataset, we filter out two sets of malicious posts, one using URL blacklists and another using human annotations. Our observations reveal some characteristic differences between malicious posts obtained from the two methodologies, thus demanding a twofold filtering process for a more complete and robust filtering system. We empirically confirm the need for this twofold filtering approach by cross-validating supervised learning models obtained from the two sets of malicious posts. These supervised learning models include Naive Bayesian, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine-based models. Based on this learning, we implement Facebook Inspector, a REST API-based browser plug-in for identifying malicious Facebook posts in real time. Facebook Inspector uses class probabilities obtained from two independent supervised learning models based on a Random Forest classifier to identify malicious posts in real time. These supervised learning models are based on a feature set comprising of 44 features and achieve an accuracy of over 80% each, using only publicly available features. During the first 9 months of its public deployment (August 2015–May 2016), Facebook Inspector processed 0.97 million posts at an average response time of 2.6 s per post and was downloaded over 2500 times.

The survey was conducted in late 2016 and taken by 233 participants. The results show that many are worried about cyber threats and about their children exploring the online domain. However, seminars do not seem to be a priority as many individuals were only willing to spend 1-1.5h on seminars.', 'title': 'Survey results on adults and cybersecurity education'}\n",

Voting has been an accepted means for electing candidates, receiving public approval for referendums and budgets, and for many other tasks where the will of the people, whether a broad population or a select group, can be recorded and measured in a tangible way. Because of advances in technology, together with problems inherent in manual forms of voting, the concepts and issues relating to electronic voting (e-voting) and various other technology-based forms, are been proposed, discussed, and examined. The goal of all such systems is the casting and recording of the votes from eligible voters as they intended to be cast, with adequate security. This security requires that there be no identifiable connection between the voter and the vote that is cast, while providing an audit trail that can be used to validate that every vote was counted and tallied, as cast. Current research has shown that such systems form the majority of the nascent e-voting technologies, primarily because they have come closest to solving the usability and security issues inherent in technology-based voting systems.', 'title': 'E-Voting Technologies Usability: A Critical Element for Enabling Successful Elections'}\n",

However, it is well-known that existing distance vector routing protocols are insecure due to: 1) the lack of strong authentication and authorization mechanisms; 2) the difficulty, if not impossibility, of validating routing updates which are aggregated results of other routers. In this paper, we introduce a secure routing protocol, namely S-RIP, based on a distance vector approach. In S-RIP, a router confirms the consistency of an advertised route with those nodes that have propogated that route. A reputation-based framework is proposed for determining how many nodes should be consulted, flexibly balancing security and efficiency. Our threat analysis and simulation results show that in S-RIP, a well-behaved node can uncover inconsistent routing information in a network with many misbehaving nodes assuming (in the present work) no two of them are in collusion, with relatively low extra routing overhead.', 'title': 'S-RIP: A Secure Distance Vector Routing Protocol'}\n",

At the time of writing most data in the home is stored manually. The widespread use of the Internet, home pc’s and mobile devices now means that increasingly individuals (and families) are storing “home information” electronically.

Information on specific data security related issues is widely available in terms of “how to protect your pc” and there are also many products that are available to assist with this. The level of actual understanding that home users have of the general data security issues and the means that they take to protect themselves are not well documented. The approach taken in this paper is to look at many of the data security threats posed to existing ICT devices and to put them in the context of systems that are currently used or may be used in future, in the home environment.

The primary focus is the potential for malicious acts being committed by unauthorised use of the systems. Where are the threats from and what can be done to alleviate them? Are the main vulnerabilities in the connectivity, the systems, or both? Since technology now softens the “environmental” boundaries, this paper alludes to the scope of the home environment. It also discusses existing solutions to perceived threats; whether they appear to be understood and whether they appear to be working. It looks for the evidence to demonstrate the significance of data security in relation to the development of “intelligent homes”. The paper then takes into consideration the directions in which technology appears to be developing in arriving at conclusions.', 'title': 'DATA SECURITY THREATS IN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT'}\n",

The potential uses for social in healthcare are vast, but it is important to understand how they can be utilized securely before they are adapted for widespread use.

In the United Kingdom—as in many other cases—central to this agenda is the notion that children are at risk online. In this context, “risk refers to the probability of damage, injury, illness, death or other misfortune associated with hazard. Hazards are generally defined to mean a threat to people and what they value” (Furedi, 2006, p. 25). Yet as this chapter will endeavor to show, these risks are not “absolute truths,” rather they are selected (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982, p. 29). This is not to deny that real dangers exist but rather to emphasize that a choice is made regarding which hazards to focus upon. Consequently, decisions regarding which risks should be causes for public concern, and the precise nature of such “hazards,” are always political in nature. Thus, it follows that the school e-safety agenda should not be seen merely as an attempt to care for the well-being of children, but also to impose particular ways of seeing and behaving.', 'title': 'The Politics of Online Risk and the Discursive Construction of School “E-Safety”'}\n",

To demonstrate their value, we use an online labor market to replicate three classic experiments. The first finds quantitative agreement between levels of cooperation in a prisoner’s dilemma played online and in the physical laboratory. The second shows—consistent with behavior in the traditional laboratory—that online subjects respond to priming by altering their choices. The third demonstrates that when an identical decision is framed differently, individuals reverse their choice, thus replicating a famed Tversky-Kahneman result. Then we conduct a field experiment showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally, we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to cope with the unique threats to validity in an online setting, and examining the conceptual issues surrounding the external validity of online results. We conclude by presenting our views on the potential role that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then recommend software development priorities and best practices.', 'title': 'The online laboratory: conducting experiments in\\xa0a\\xa0real\\xa0labor\\xa0market'}\n",

This issue also arises under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime which criminalizes ‘offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems’. As the criminal law traditionally provides protection only to limited forms of information, the increasing use of the criminal law to protect computer data therefore confers on it a status not enjoyed by information stored in other forms.

This makes it difficult to make decisions about which resources can be relied upon and which entities it is safe to interact with. Trust and reputation systems are aimed at solving this problem by enabling service consumers to reliably assess the quality of services and the reliability of entities before they decide to use a particular service or to interact with or depend on a given entity. Such systems should also allow serious service providers and online players to correctly represent the reliability of themselves and the quality of their services. In the case of reputation systems, the basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive its reputation score. In the case of trust systems, the basic idea is to analyse and combine paths and networks of trust relationships in order to derive measures of trustworthiness of specific nodes. Reputation scores and trust measures can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with a given party in the future, and whether it is safe to depend on a given resource or entity. This represents an incentive for good behaviour and for offering reliable resources, which thereby tends to have a positive effect on the quality of online markets and communities.

In the real world, the current or historical people’s good reputation usually ensures a high degree of reliability of the information and data received from them.

While there are numerous benefits accompanying this medium, the Internet is not without its perils. In this case study article, we focus specifically on the challenge of fake (or unnatural) online identities, such as those used to defraud people and organisations, with the aim of exploring an approach to detect them.Case descriptionIn particular, through our method and case study we outline and experiment with novel analytics for characterising and measuring the naturalness of an online persona or identity; this naturalness is defined as the extent to which that persona has features similar to those expected for comparable personae online. Our case scenario involves a participant set of two types of individuals, and our aim at this stage is to use our approach to correctly characterise, and then distinguish between, these two types.Discussion and evaluationTo briefly précis our case study results, we found that our method to conceptualise an individual’s complete online presence was very successful. This was undoubtedly linked to its detailed consideration of how cyberspace is typically used, while also building on our existing model of identity which has been used to aid law enforcement in identification tasks. In terms of developing effective analytics for naturalness however, improvements in our approach (e.g., features selected and nuanced metrics) are required. Moreover, the study would benefit from a larger sample size to better identify common aspects between natural personae.ConclusionsOverall, the case study allowed us to explore a novel technique to characterise naturalness and to examine its utility at detecting unnatural personae. Our goal now is to build on the study’s findings in several key ways. Specifically, we aim to conduct further assessments on the criteria through which naturalness is defined, and refine our analytics and combinatorics to measure a persona’s naturalness. We will also explore clustering approaches based on complete online personae, as a means to complement our identification of naturally occurring personae types in large datasets.', 'title': 'Analytics for characterising and measuring the naturalness of online personae'}\n",

Since the normal operation of the mobile Internet depends on the trust between nodes, the existing trusted measurement model cannot fully and dynamically evaluate mobile Internet computing nodes, and the trust transmission has a great deal of energy consumption. Aiming at above problems, this paper proposes a trusted measurement model combining static measurement and node behavior measurement. The model is based on the computing environment measurement of the mobile Internet computing node, and is also based on node behavior measurement, combining direct and recommended trust values to complete the measurement of nodes. It can more objectively reflect the trust degree of nodes, effectively detecting malicious nodes, and ensuring the normal operation of mobile Internet services. The simulation experiment results show that this method can effectively balance the subjectivity and objectivity of trust assessment, and can quickly avoid malicious nodes and reduce the energy consumption of the trust transmission.', 'title': 'A Trusted Measurement Model for Mobile Internet'}\n",

Although there have been and may continue to be Mafia-type criminal associations in some countries, the majority of crimes, even transnational crimes, are organised in a more differentiated and subtle way by looser network structures which may fit into the definition of article 140 of the Dutch Code or RICO, but which are harder to destroy than a hierarchical pyramid of the traditional image. Within this broad framework, there are pockets of very major crime groups with transnational economic and criminal interests, which have hitherto eluded successful criminal justice intervention.

To date, scholarly efforts that have investigated societal response to crimes of the powerful have limited their field of inquiry to public opinions about white-collar crime. Although these studies have provided valuable empirical evidence of a growing concern among U.S. citizens regarding the danger posed by elite offenses, their failure to include a valid measure of lay knowledge about white-collar crime significantly limits our ability to infer the extent to which the public is familiar with the scope and magnitude of this social issue. The present study seeks to address such limitations by providing the first measure of public knowledge about white-collar crime. Four hundred and eight participants completed an online questionnaire that measured their knowledge about white-collar crime. Results revealed that participants were not sufficiently informed about it and suggest the existence of popular “myths” about crimes of the powerful. These findings have important implications insofar as white-collar crime awareness programs are concerned. Hypothetically, public demand for tougher sanctions against high-status offenders could result from exposure to relevant information about white-collar crime. Nevertheless, “myth” adherence might also undermine the effect of increased awareness on prosecutorial efforts against upper-class criminality.', 'title': 'Public knowledge about white-collar crime: an exploratory study'}\n",

Criminologists and international law enforcement have been attracted to the cause of examining demographic context on which a crime is likely to arise. Traditionally, little has been explored in using demographic variables as determinants of the aggregate level of crime in the crime literature. Rapid development and ubiquitous application of information technology enables academic field to perform crime analysis using visualization techniques. Automation and networking make it available to access massive amounts of crime data, typically in the form of crime statistics. In numerous fields, studies and research have shown that visualization techniques are valuable; in crime research, nevertheless, there is a general lack of its application. In order to efficiently and effectively process crime data, criminologists and law enforcement are in demand of a more powerful tool. The self-organizing map (SOM), one of the widely used neural network algorithms, may be an appropriate technique for this application. The purpose of this study is to apply the SOM to mapping countries with different situations of crime. A total of 56 countries and 28 variables are included in the study. We found that some roughly definite patterns of crime situation can be identified in traditionally homogeneous countries. In different countries, positive correlation on crime in some countries may have negative correlation in other countries. Overall, correlation of some factors on crime can still be concluded in most groups.

Despite considerable efforts to evaluate particular security and usability features in e-banking systems, a dedicated security and usability evaluation model that can be used as a guide in the development of e-banking assets remains much less explored. To build a comprehensive security and usability evaluation framework, we first extract security and usability evaluation metrics from the conducted literature review and then include several other evaluation metrics that were not previously identified in the literature. We then propose a structured inspection model for thoroughly evaluating the usability and security of internal and external e-banking assets. We argue that the proposed e-banking security and usability evaluation frameworks in the literature in addition to the existing standards of security best practices (e.g., NIST and ISO) are by no means comprehensive and lack some essential and key evaluation metrics that are of particular interest to e-banking portals. In order to demonstrate the inadequacy of existing models, we use the proposed framework to evaluate five major banks.

In November 2016, a number of international conferences on sustainability have been held in Marrakech, Morocco such as the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22), 12th session of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 12), and the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1). The success of these conferences confirmed the commitment of Paris Agreement implementation and continued cooperation of many countries on the climate change issue. Vietnam is a developing country that has taken part in the implementation of sustainable development; however, there are still environmental concerns due to unawareness of the issue and the irresponsible behaviours of organizations and individuals. This study aims to examine the advantages and disadvantages associated with sustainability awareness in Vietnam’s higher education sector. Via an online questionnaire, 281 participants were surveyed. Results indicate that the three advantages of sustainability adoption are: improved efficiency and reduction in resource usage, fulfilment of investor expectations and differentiating achievements, and reduction of environmental impacts. The two disadvantages are the possibility that there will be breaches of regulations and compliance; and an increase in the number of scandals, crises and failures due to environmental problems, irresponsibility and disasters. Educators in Vietnam should consider the sustainability issue in their courses in order to raise the awareness of students. Additionally, to ensure the success of sustainability implementation, businesses should ensure that all staff at every level of the organisation is clear about sustainability and sustainability practices.', 'title': 'Sustainability Awareness in Vietnam’s Higher Education Sector'}\n",

The connexins constitute a multigene family of polytopic membrane proteins that have four transmembrane hydrophobic domains, M1 to M4, two extracellular loops, E1 and E2, with the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus located cytoplasmically. There is a single cytoplasmic loop between M2 and M3. The different connexin isoforms can interact structurally in various ways: homomeric hemichannels are composed of a single connexin isoform; heteromeric hemichannels are composed by at least two different isoforms; homotypic junctional channels are formed by twelve identical connexin subunits; heterotypic channels are formed by two hemichannels that are each homomeric for different isoforms. The expression of multiple connexin isoforms in the same cell type, the multiplicity of isoforms, as well as their different structural combinations, likely provide exquisite functional tuning of this unique family of membrane channels. In spite of the diverse subunit compositions, the fundamental structure of the hemichannel is probably similar in unpaired hemichannels and junctional channels, and for channels formed by different connexin isoforms. The hexameric hemichannel with a central pore is clearly a conserved motif of gap junction channels that can be viewed as modular in design. Electron cryo-crystallography shows that the transmembrane region of each hemichannel is formed by a bundle of 24 α-helices that are staggered with respect to those in the apposed hemichannel. This stagger may be required for interdigitation of the structures formed by the extracellular loops across the gap, which fold at least in part as antiparallel β-strands. Sequence homology in the extracellular domains suggests common mechanisms for hemichannel interactions. The second extracellular loop, E2, guides selectivity in docking between hemichannels formed by different isoforms. However, there is considerably more sequence variability of the portion (i.e., second half) of E2, suggesting that this region dictates specificity of hemichannel docking. The cytoplasmic loop, and especially the carboxyl-terminal domain, are the most divergent regions between different connexins, and confer unique functional or regulatory properties for channels formed by different connexins. The pore itself can accommodate molecules up to ˜1 kDa, which allows the cell–cell exchange of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules to coordinate the metabolic and electrical activities of tissues. The extracellular surface of the pore is bounded by a continuous wall of protein that forms a tight seal to prevent the loss of permeants to the extracellular space. Mutagenesis, biochemical, dye transfer, and electrophysiological data, combined with computational studies, have suggested possible assignments for the four transmembrane α-helices within each subunit. The map derived by electron cryo-crystallography shows that the transmembrane region of the pore within each hemichannel is bounded by twelve α-helices, two contributed by each connexin subunit. Most current models assign either M1 or M3 as pore-lining α-helices and M4 is agreed to be on the perimeter of the channel. Mapping of human mutations onto a suggested Cα model predicts that mutations that disrupt helix–helix packing impair channel function. In spite of this substantial progress in understanding the structural biology of gap junction channels, an experimentally determined structure at atomic resolution will be essential to confirm and clarify this working model.', 'title': 'Gap Junction Channel Structure'}\n",

The specific aim of this research was to study unwanted online attentions (UOA) among a sample of Italian students (N\\u2009=\\u2009585, mean age\\u2009=\\u200914.5), identifying UOA as all those behaviors carried out through the Internet and technology to annoy, disturb, offend, humiliate, intimidate, threat, harass, harm or attack others. The online questionnaire investigated the online habits of the students, the presence of UOA and the characteristics of victims and perpetrators, the perception and emotional impact of such conducts, and the victims' possible reactions. The findings offer an estimate of the prevalence of these behaviors in the population of this age group in the area considered. More importantly, the results reveal a very high involvement in technology by the students accompanied by a lack of awareness regarding the risks connected to technology use as well as a low perception of UOA. These results give evidence of the needs in terms of prevention and education instruments in order to improve the system of responses to cybervictimization among young people.\", 'title': 'Unwanted Online Attentions Among an Italian Students Sample'}\n",

Complete data were collected from 295 participants. We indirectly determined levels of cheating by examining the pattern of test-score differences across the two conditions. We directly measured dropout rates, test performance, and participants’ perceived tension and invasion of privacy.FindingsThe use of remote proctoring was associated with more negative test-taker reactions and decreased cheating. Remote proctoring did not directly affect test performance or interact with individual differences to predict test performance or test-taker reactions.ImplicationsTechnological advances in selection should be accompanied by empirical evidence.

Using data collected from stakeholders in 17 European countries, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.A. from 2003 through 2007, a qualitative analysis identifies 10 dominant stakeholder areas of concern which we term ‘themes’. These are then mapped onto a framework of public value due to Grimsley and Meehan which relates services to outcomes and the development of trust. We conclude by questioning the conceptualisation of trust within the context of IdM, and suggesting that considering trust as the mitigation of relational risk is more appropriate. We also consider the usefulness of public value as a notion for informing IdM and highlight the lack of national differences in our diverse data set.', 'title': 'Expectations and outcomes in electronic identity management: the role of trust and public value'}\n",

Ethical responses to the pervasiveness of Internet-enhanced plagiarism require a reorientation of perspective on both plagiarism and the Internet as a knowledge tool.

We define automated traffic as any search query not generated by a human in real time. We first provide examples of different categories of query logs generated by automated means. We then develop many different features that distinguish between queries generated by people searching for information, and those generated by automated processes. We categorize these features into two classes, either an interpretation of the physical model of human interactions, or as behavioral patterns of automated interactions. Using the these detection features, we next classify the query stream using multiple binary classifiers. In addition, a multiclass classifier is then developed to identify subclasses of both normal and automated traffic. An active learning algorithm is used to suggest which user sessions to label to improve the accuracy of the multiclass classifier, while also seeking to discover new classes of automated traffic. Performance analysis are then provided.

It chronicles not only the opaque circumstances that brought Omar Bongo to power in 1967 but also the trajectory that enabled him to sustain his despotic rule over Gabon for almost 42 years and in a way that paved the way to the quasi dynastic succession that allowed his son to easily succeed him upon his death in 2009. Not only was Omar Bongo the longest-serving head of state in the world at the time of his death, Gabon is also now, arguably, the only so-called Republic, that is, the only non-officially monarchical system in the world, to have been ruled not only by the same family, but also by the same regime, for fifty-three years (and counting). This paper argues that at the core of this dynastic succession—and the “monarchical Republic” that ensued—was Omar Bongo’s ability to undo the presidential term-limit provisions that had been agreed upon by national consensus and erected in the constitution that followed the 1990 National Conference that brought multiparty politics back to the country after more than two decades of the absolutist dictatorship that had defined the politics of the country until then.', 'title': 'The Making of a Monarchical Republic: The Undoing of Presidential Term Limits in Gabon Under Omar Bongo'}\n",

The most popular bets placed to win, had a relatively high rate of losses and lowest average returns, which may reflect less sophisticated betting behaviour. More specific handicap and total bets were placed by fewer customers, but were larger bets with the greatest returns. Similarly, bets placed on less popular sporting events had greater average returns potentially reflecting greater customer sophistication and knowledge raising the possibility of a proportion of bettors being more ‘skilled’.

Causes of failure are mainly social cultural and economic challenges rather than technical and security factors. The various failures come at a soaring price for the world’s poorest countries.

Appropriate regulation of identity in a ubiquitous information environment is seen as one of the major drivers of the future Internet economy. Regulation of personal identity data has come to the fore including mapping conducted on digital personhood by the OECD; work on human rights and profiling by the Council of Europe andmajor studies by the European Commission with regard to self-regulation in the privacy market, electronic identity technical interoperability and enhanced safety for young people. These domains overlap onto an increasingly complex model of regulation of individuals' identity management, online and offline. This chapter argues that policy makers struggle to deal with issues concerning electronic identity, due to the apparently irrational and unpredictable behavior of users when engaging in online interactions involving identity management. Building on empirical survey evidence from four EU countries, we examine the first aspect in detail – citizens' management of identity in a digital environment. We build on data from a large scale (n = 5,265) online survey of attitudes to electronic identity among young Europeans (France, Germany, Spain, UK) conducted in August 2008. The survey asked questions about perceptions and acceptance of risks, general motivations, attitudes and behaviors concerning electronic identity. Four behavioral paradoxes are identified in the analysis: a privacy paradox (to date well known), but also a control paradox, a responsibility paradox and an awareness paradox. The chapter then examines the paradoxes in relation of three main policy dilemmas framing the debate on digital identity. The paper concludes by arguing for an expanded identity debate spanning policy circles and the engineering community.\", 'title': \"The Policy Maker's Anguish: Regulating Personal Data Behavior Between Paradoxes and Dilemmas\"}\n",

These include: 1) the ability to manage healthcare expenses; 2) pay medical bills; 3) determine health needs and understand treatment options; and 4) make sound healthcare decisions with financial resources available. Despite some overlap with health insurance literacy, financial health literacy would define an area of need encompassing health management choices and health plan selections integrated with other financial management issues including living arrangements, financial planning, and retirement planning.ConclusionsPotential initiatives should be considered to help at-risk older adults find resources to improve their financial health literacy, which in turn will enhance their abilities to manage medical choices in the environment of an increasingly complex healthcare system.', 'title': 'The growing need for resources to help older adults manage their financial and healthcare choices'}\n",

The United Nations (UN) conceptualises child online protection as efforts to create a safe and empowering online experience for children through legal measures, technical and procedural measures, organisational structures, capacity building, and international cooperation. This chapter uses universal design as a point of departure for examining child online protection using a review of key literature and a critical analysis of select policy documents from the UN. This chapter approaches child online protection from a universal design perspective so that policymakers, information and communication technology (ICT) developers, advocates, and researchers can reframe their efforts. A universal design perspective suggests that ICT service providers must ensure that children have equal access to and use of ICT. This includes identifying and removing barriers that children experience accessing and using ICT due to, for example, their age or disability. Age-related barriers include the risks and vulnerabilities that children experience online such as exposure to harmful or dangerous content. Disability-related barriers could include, for example, the design of technical and procedural measures, such as content rating systems, that are inaccessible or unusable for children with physical, sensory, cognitive, or psychosocial disabilities.', 'title': 'Universal Design and Child Online Protection'}\n",

We choose to address adults not because we consider conversations with young people unimportant. To the contrary, we will argue throughout this book that intergenerational dialogue is crucial to navigating the challenges that confront us. Nor, in addressing our audience, is our invocation of the first-person plural (‘we’) intended to gloss the differences that shape diverse groups’ and individuals’ conceptualizations of, access to and use of technology. Rather, the desire is to assert a heterogeneous ‘we’ that nonetheless shares the experience of ‘being adult’—or, at least, of being no longer young—and, generationally speaking, enjoys the privilege of the unmarked case (Livingstone and Third 2017, 661). Acknowledging this, the book draws upon the attitudes, experiences and feelings of a diverse range of young people, who played a central role in the research that is elaborated here. This is deliberate, because adult ways of being have dominated, for too long, how young people and the digital are configured in mainstream debates. We contend that alternative ways of thinking and doing are urgently demanded, and that young people’s insights and experiences are a powerful and necessary resource for such a reorientation.', 'title': 'Introduction'}\n",

The mere terminology became the source of vivid discussions, especially since individuals with a legal background questioned the usage of the word `theft’ in association with identity. The main question from the legal front became: can someone steal an identity? Traditional definitions of theft in criminal law conflicted with the meaning of the term as used in the concept of identity theft. Certain sources therefore labelled identity theft a misnomer or referred to the concept as `awkward.’ Some even demonstrate a complete disdain for the term. Others, on the other hand, embrace the concept and its accuracy. Clare Sullivan supports the usage of the concept of identity theft and states ``[d]ishonest use of an individual’s token identity by another person is a denial of the individual’s right to the exclusive use of his/her transactional identity, and its use by another person fundamentally damages the integrity of the individual’s token identity.” The acceptance of identity theft as a concept requires a stretch of the term theft and also a more progressive approach to the idea of property, which is a considerable challenge due to traditional meanings in the legal arena. The availability of a popular alternative—identity fraud—provides those opposed to the use of identity theft as a concept an opportunity to circumvent the problem. However, the problems associated with the usage of identity theft as a concept only proved to be the proverbial tip of the iceberg. The much larger challenge remains. This is the challenge of the problem definition. To address this challenge, this chapter shifts the discussion from the ‘legal’ to the public policy arena in an effort to develop a more thorough understanding of the definitional dilemmas. This shift of arena provides for a more comprehensive approach to the issue of problem definitions since it surpasses the rigidity of legal debate.', 'title': 'Definitional Dilemmas'}\n",

The copyright protection in the digitalized technology has witnessed an economic setback to the copyright holder and its quick and simple accessibility; a boon to the violators. Digitalization has also enabled information to be easily stored, reproduced and transmitted through internet as the web 2.0 era has made information storage, sharing and collaboration easier. The digitalisation has made the cyberspace an interwoven virtual community. While the digitalization of copyright material has made the information access easy and available, it has rather posed complications, technical and non-technical hitches to the holders/owners in a multi-faced ways. Combating piracy i.e. mass piracy, counterfeiting, circumventing methods etc., have all challenged the existing laws. The international pressure of the copyright holders has pressured the states to pass various laws and under the ambit of the WIPO that brought WCT and WPPT, most of the states are proposing their laws to be at par with the international changes in the copyright law. The copyright protection had problems and challenges during all the phases of digital technology. The major changes that took place with serious concerns are in the two major phases’ that are well known as Low-Tech and High-Tech Era. The further classification of the Digital Era can be basically divided into the Analog Phase and Digital phase which have further intensified the infringements with greater challenges to the law makers. However, it is found that states are slowly sliding from the civil remedy approach to that of criminalisation of the copyright law, aiming to fulfil the demands and rationale anguish of the copyright holders’. This change is seen rather in almost all the countries, as the copyright holders are keen for criminal law to prevail at least in few circumstances. In the US both these phases have seen various laws passed by the congress to criminalise copyright like the ACPA, RICO, NET, DMCA, Pro-IP Act etc. The European Union has also brought in changes in order to criminalise the copyright infringements with the Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society and Directive on Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights along the lines of WIPO and TRIPs. India though is not a signatory to the WCT and WPPT; it amended the Copyright Law in the year 2012 and added section 65A, that criminalises the copyright infringement in the electronic/digital forms especially relating anti-circumvention and Rights Management Information. The criminalisation of copyright violation is shaping up in a new direction since the advancement of technology. The criminal liability is present either with the civil remedy or in addition to the civil remedy. The digital era has three fold violators i.e. the mass violators who violate copyright law for the commercial purpose, the user (individual users) and the new member is the Online Service Provider (OSP) who may have knowledge of copyright violations while providing services. Overall it can be observed that there is an overthrow of laws since Napsters (P2P) and in addition with the online hosting. As they pose newer challenges that are expected to have deadly effects on the copyright. In this paper the author would look into the changes in copyright law and its inclination towards criminalisation and its impact.', 'title': 'Criminalization of Copyrights Infringements in the Digital Era with Special Reference to India'}\n",

The study method is descriptive and uses independent sample t tests to identify significant differences over time and between countries. The major findings are fourfold. First, some topics’ coverage and/or scandals exist in most of the sample’s books based on their indexes. However, the page coverage for these topics/scandals is not overwhelming when compared to the number of pages in these texts. Second, the scandals/troubled corporations’ page coverage increased between the earliest and the later editions as did a depth of coverage trend measure. Third, U.S. texts in the sample contained significantly more pages devoted to these topics and scandals than the non-adapted Canadian sample texts. Finally, and as expected, the sampled auditing texts contain significantly more pages devoted to these topics and scandals compared to the other financial accounting texts in the sample.

This study set out to investigate higher education teachers’ perceptions of the prevalence and types of cheating in their courses with a focus on the possible changes that might come about as a result of an increased use of e-assessment, ways of addressing cheating, and how the use of student authentication and authorship checking systems might impact on assessment practice. This study was carried out within the context of the project TeSLA (an Adaptive Trust-based e-assessment System for Learning) which is developing a system intended for integration within an institution’s Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) offering a variety of instruments to assure student authentication and authorship checking. Data was collected at two universities that were trialling the TeSLA system, one in Turkey, where the main modes of teaching are face-to-face teaching and distance education, and one in Bulgaria, where the main modes of teaching are face-to-face teaching and blended learning. The study used questionnaires and interviews, building on existing TeSLA project evaluation activities and extending these to explore the specific areas we wished to examine in more depth.In three of the four contexts cheating was seen by teachers as a serious and growing problem, the exception was the distance education context where the teachers believed that the existing procedures were effective in controlling cheating. Most teachers in all four contexts expected cheating to become a greater problem with increased use of e-assessment. Student authentication was not seen as a major problem in any of the contexts, as this was felt to be well controlled through face-to-face proctored assessments, though the problem of assuring effective authentication was seen by many teachers as a barrier to increased use of e-assessment. Authorship checking was seen as a major issue in all contexts, as copying and pasting from the web, ghost writing and plagiarism were all reported as widely prevalent, and authorship checking was seen as becoming even more important with increased use of e-assessment. Teachers identified a third category of cheating behaviours, which was the accessing of information from other students, from written materials, and from the internet during assessments.Teachers identified a number of approaches to addressing the problem of cheating: education, technology, assessment design, sanctions, policy, and surveillance. Whilst technology was not seen as the most important approach to prevention, student authentication and authorship checking systems were seen as relevant in terms of reducing reliance on face-to-face proctored examinations, and in improving the quality of assessment through supporting the employment of a wider range of assessment methods. The development of authorship checking based on computational linguistic approaches was an area of particular interest. Student authentication and authorship checking systems were not seen as being able to address the third category of cheating behaviours that the study identified.', 'title': 'Addressing cheating in e-assessment using student authentication and authorship checking systems: teachers’ perspectives'}\n",

Actually, these products can also be considered in terms of their relation to the first three Industrial Revolutions: the First Industrial Revolution (circa 1800) was primarily focused on the production of goods; the Second Industrial Revolution (circa 1900) was primarily focused on the mass production of goods; and the Third Industrial Revolution (circa 2000) has been primarily focused on the mass customization of goods, services or servgoods. In this follow-up paper, the Third Industrial Revolution of mass customization continues to accelerate in its evolution and, in many respects, is subsuming the earlier Industrial Revolutions of production and mass production. More importantly, with the advent of real-time decision making, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, mobile networks, and other advanced digital technologies, customization has been extensively enabled, thereby advancing mass customization into a Fourth Industrial Revolution of real-time customization. Moreover, the moral, ethical, security and employment problems associated with both mass and real-time customization must be carefully assessed and mitigated, especially in regard to unintended consequences. Looking ahead and with the advance of artificial general intelligence, this Fourth Industrial Revolution could be forthcoming in about the middle of the 21st Century; it would allow for multiple activities to be simultaneously tackled in real-time and in a customized manner.', 'title': 'Toward the Fourth Industrial Revolution on Real-Time Customization'}\n",

The lead author of the publications, Haruko Obokata, became an overnight celebrity in Japan, where she was dubbed the new face of Japanese science.

Other laboratories and researchers (including authors on the original papers) found that they were unable to replicate Obokata et al.’s work. Closer scrutiny of the papers by the scientific community also suggested that there was manipulation of images that had been published, and Obokata was accused of misconduct.

Not only does webcam sex tourism provide easy access to child abuse and child abuse images for child abusers, it also a crime that has a comparatively low risk for the offenders. Live webcam performances leave few traces and little evidence that law enforcement can use. Further difficulties arise from the fact that webcam sex tourism often has a cross-border character, which causes jurisdictional conflicts and makes it more difficult to obtain evidence or even launch an investigation. The Dutch children’s rights organization Terre des Hommes (TdH) was the first NGO to actively tackle webcam child sex tourism by using a virtual character called ‘Sweetie’ to identify offenders in chatrooms and online forums. Since then, Sweetie has been further developed into a chatbot, called Sweetie 2.0, to automate interaction with offenders. But using artificial intelligence raises serious legal questions. Sweetie as an investigative tool is so innovative, that it is unclear whether its use is actually covered by existing rules of criminal procedure. However, the question of criminal procedural legality of Sweetie is preceded by a prior substantive criminal law question: is interacting with Sweetie in a sexually charged way a criminal offence in the first place, given that Sweetie is not a person, but a virtual avatar? An answer to this question is important, because if webcam sex tourism with a virtual avatar is not considered criminal, it will be much harder to make the case that Sweetie is an acceptable investigative method.

How to accurately recognize the IWA has become a challenging research issue. Most work exploits the behavioral analysis to distinguish IWA and non-IWA. These approaches are mainly divided into categories: direct compute method and training learning method. The direct calculation method mainly relies on crawler, and makes multidimensional eigenvector to detect IWA. Nevertheless, it did not consider the behavior rules based on the time sequence, and just determine the user behavior by feather vector, so the results are not very accurate. The recognition rate also needs to be improved. The second method mainly relies on cluster approaches. However, cluster approaches require pre-determined the number of clustering, which will directly lead to the model over fitting and owe fitting because of inadequate unit number. In this paper we propose a sequential pattern approach based on DPMM for IWA identification. Firstly, we analyze the user behavior of potential IWA and get a feature vector of user behavior. Secondly, we use DPMM to get effective and accurate clustering results. Finally, we use the sequential pattern mining algorithms to detect navy accounts.

How, why and with what consequences have Russia’s political elites transformed the country’s media landscape in the years since 2011? In order to answer these questions, this article leverages a recent theory of “authoritarian publics” proposed by one of the authors. According to this theoretical account, the multiple public sphere of contemporary authoritarian regimes can be productively imagined as being comprised of a myriad of competing partial publics of three types: (1) uncritical, (2) policy-critical, and (3) leadership-critical. Adopting this framework as a lens, the article argues that the measures implemented by Russia’s leadership in the wake of the protests significantly reduced the audience reach of leadership-critical publics, but did not entirely eradicate publics of this type. On a more abstract level, the measures taken are interpreted here as measures of “institutional gardening” deployed by the country’s ruling elites in order to fine-tune the balance between the three types of publics. By so doing, they created an authoritarian public at large that better met their reconfigured needs.', 'title': 'The “Gardening” of an Authoritarian Public at Large: How Russia’s Ruling Elites Transformed the Country’s Media Landscape After the 2011/12 Protests “For Fair Elections”'}\n",

In this context, policing the border is becoming a centrepiece of state intervention (Weber, 2006), and is increasingly mobile, incorporating pre-emptive and repressive measures both at and beyond the physical border.

Five practices are discussed and illustrated: surveillance by glitch, surveillance by default, surveillance by design, surveillance by possession, and surveillance by subject. The article offers some tentative conclusions about the progressive latency of tracking devices, about the complexity created by multi-sourcing, about the robustness of clickstream data, and about the erosion of the distinction between the monitor and the monitored. These trends emphasize the need to reject analysis that frames our understanding of Internet surveillance in terms of its “impact” on society.

This means that some of these narratives can be discussed multiple times to fully explore all of the nuances. Narratives impart knowledge that often leads to a change in attitude. This chapter selects a few narratives as examples and gives discussion questions and sample didactic content for instructors and facilitators.', 'title': 'Discussion Guide for Health Disparities Case Narratives'}\n",

It encompasses the concepts of universities and their societal roles, and considers the definitions of innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. It argues that innovation and entrepreneurship can be taught in the right circumstances. The personal qualities needed to be an entrepreneur are described. An account is given of intellectual property (IP), especially patents and copyright works, together with its regulation in different jurisdictions, registration, defence, and exploitation. Governments have a pivotal role in facilitating start-up companies and the ease of conducting business. Also important is their interaction with international bodies such as the World Trade Organization and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, World Intellectual Property Organization etc., and international indices such as the World Competitiveness Index. Governments can assist this crucial phase of university development, but should not interfere with universities, by a combination of adequate education and research funding together with setting up national technology foresight and related exercises, participating in regional initiatives to establish large-scale research and development facilities, and promoting competition. The combination of quality assurance, societally relevant teaching and research, accreditation, university-based and university-associated business and technology parks, business incubators and similar structures, alongside business schools, represent the main routes to successful delivery of university-derived IP. Even so, much depends on the quality, energy, experience, attitudes, and contact network of those leading these structures, and those of the associated academic staff. The roles of banks, venture capitalists, business angels, IP lawyers, and accountants in establishing a business are described, and the role and design of business plans outlined. Worrisome aspects of IP theft are described although there is little prospect of preventing it at this juncture in international relationships. Opportunities arising from the raft of transformative technologies under development are described, along with opportunities arising from international trends in convenience, fashion, design, entertainment, and diet. Climate change and the problems of water, energy, and food security offer huge opportunities for university-based innovations in STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, medicine). Challenges come from (a) the level of competition; (b) dominating position of the US and Chinese tech giants absorbing talent and finance; (c) venture capital based mainly in the US and Europe; (d) US Supreme Court ruling on the patentability of software; and (e) problems of doing business in the Arab world and its attitudes to R&D and innovation. The overview ends with guidelines on establishing a business or company, and special features to consider when doing so in the Arab world. An appendix details advice for IP guidance for staff and students, plus supplements to institution-supplied laboratory and other notebooks with instructions for (a) record keeping required for accreditation and IP litigation; (b) code of institutional practice; (c) institutional quality plan; (d) standard operating procedures; and (e) equipment logbooks.', 'title': 'Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship in Academia: A Review'}\n",

This understanding reached its peak in humans, who have learned over millennia, in relatively stable environments, to take steps to protect not only themselves but also their physical/tangible assets/possessions (including individual property, cities, national boundaries, etc). More recently, as a result of the very rapid advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) a new electronic world (E-world) full of intangible assets, shadowy figures and processes is being created. It is a complex and fast changing world with associated new opportunities, dangers, threats and risks, where a steady stream of new applications threaten to outstrip our understanding. Consequently the issue of E-World crime and security is attracting increasing attention. There appear to be two main streams in the debate. One implies that it is mainly a technology issue and the other that is a human (people) issue. This paper will begin with a short description of the development of the new E-World and the opportunities and benefits. This will be followed by a summary of the old issues and a comparison with some of the perceived new threats and risks. This will lead directly to suggestions as to how to mitigate these risks at four levels — individual, organizational, national and global. A short summary of the available security technology is included to demonstrate the steps that can be taken to ensure varying degrees of protection. Unfortunately it appears that these are often not deployed effectively. This reinforces the view that E-World security is a people issue that should be effectively addressed through a combination of education and responsible cooperation between organisations and national governments to ensure appropriate global legislation and law enforcement policies across all jurisdictions.', 'title': 'E-World Security: A Pragmatic View'}\n",

In the proposed approach, we extend the traditional architecture of SOA implementations to support generic and lightweight agents that reside at the client site. These agents, that we call “Service representatives”, can be customized and trained based on the provider generated role description and knowledge to perform their assigned tasks. In addition to providing innovative applications, such a technique allows for more sophisticated features such as maintaining client privacy and separating the functionality of the service and its delegated agent. To indicate the variety of roles that can be done by the service representative, we provide three case studies to show how a local and generic agent can be customized by different providers to personalize financial advice, apply medical guidelines, and verify credit card transactions.', 'title': 'Modeling service representatives in enterprise systems using generic agents'}\n",

However, police legitimacy in China is relatively problematic, partly due to their controversial exercise of power and partly because of corruption. As such, the police are under tremendous pressure to demonstrate their crime-fighting capability through internal reforms, better coordination with the police at provincial and local levels, and the modernization of policing. The control over cross-border crime is a good indicator of China’s improved coordination and police modernization. Still, enhancing police legitimacy is a huge challenge in mainland China due to its vast size and the variations of police practices in different localities. The Lee Po case in Hong Kong raised an important question of whether the mainland security police might cross the border from the mainland to Hong Kong to “persuade,” if not “kidnap,” Lee back to the mainland. Although Lee insisted that he voluntarily sneaked back to the mainland for investigation, the disappearance of Lee demonstrated the political sensitivity of those who produced books that mixed rumors with partial facts on Chinese politics in Hong Kong. The police force remains the tool of the mainland Chinese Party-state to consolidate its political power and maintain socio-legal order. As such, religious freedom in China is bound to be constrained from the Western perspective. Ultimately, the persistent psyche of the Party-state and of the police force to perpetuate the ruling party’s dominance is the policing context that shapes China’s police operation.', 'title': 'Policing in China'}\n",

This paper reports research that examined the level of trustworthiness of online travel information from these different sources. The study used a survey of Australian travel consumers (n\\u2009=\\u200912,000) and results support the notion that there are differences in the level of trust for online travel information from different sources. Respondents ‘tended to agree’ that they trusted information provided by travel agents, information from commercial operators and comments made by travellers on third party websites. However, the highest level of trust was afforded to information provided on State government tourism websites. These results suggest that greater trust is placed in online travel comments when they are on a specific travel website than when they are on a more generic social networking website.

Detecting fake news is a daunting challenge due to subtle difference between real and fake news. As a first step of fighting with fake news, this paper characterizes hundreds of popular fake and real news measured by shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook from two perspectives: Web sites and content. Our site analysis reveals that the Web sites of the fake and real news publishers exhibit diverse registration behaviors and registration timing. In addition, fake news tends to disappear from the Web after a certain amount of time. The content characterizations on the fake and real news corpus suggest that simply applying term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is inefficient in detecting fake news, while exploring document similarity with the term and word vectors is a very promising direction for predicting fake and real news. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically study the Web sites and content characteristics of fake and real news, which will provide key insights for effectively detecting fake news on social media.', 'title': 'A First Step Towards Combating Fake News over Online Social Media'}\n",

In the case of online retailing, the emergence of online group-buying is regarded as one of the popular and burgeoning shopping models. This works through an initiator who issues the group-buying message to members with the same demand for a specific product. In this way, it can enhance the bargaining power with the producer through bulk-buying to achieve the goal of price-cutting. In this study, we proposed a conceptual model to discuss constructs which influence online group-buying behaviors. These constructs include perceived interactivity, initiator’s trust, perceived risk, word-of-mouth, and group-buying behavior intention. In the sample part, 134 valid participants with online-purchasing experiences were collected through online survey method. The conceptual model was conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM) method through SmartPLS 2.0 software to test the hypotheses proposed in this study. The results indicated that (1) perceived interactivity positively influenced the initiator’s trust, (2) initiator’s trust positively influenced group-buying behavior, (3) initiator’s trust influence the perceived risk negatively; (4) word-of-mouth positively impacted group-buying behavior; and (5) perceived risk negatively impact on group-buying behavior. Overall, the results showed a good fit for the proposed model and provided the fine predictive and explanatory power on group-buying behavior of a virtual community.', 'title': 'Factors influencing the adoption of online group-buying in virtual community'}\n",

Criminalising doping is advanced on two main grounds: as a stigmatic deterrent and as a form of retributive punishment enforced through the criminal justice system. The ‘spirit of sport’ defined by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as being based on the values of ethics, health and fair-play is identified as being undermined by the ineffectiveness of existing anti-doping policy in the current climate of doping revelations, and is assessed as relevant to public perceptions and the future of sport as a whole. The harm-reductionist approach permitting the use of certain performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) is considered as an alternative to anti-doping, taking into account athlete psychology, the problems encountered in containing doping in sport through anti-doping measures and the effect of these difficulties on the ‘spirit of sport’. This approach is dismissed in favour of criminalising doping in sport based on the offence of fraud. It will be argued that the criminalisation of doping could act as a greater deterrent than existing sanctions imposed by International Federations, and, when used in conjunction with those sanctions, will raise the overall ‘price’ of doping. The revelations of corruption within the existing system of self-governance within sport have contributed to a disbelieving public and it will be argued that the criminalisation of doping in sport could assist in satisfying the public that justice is being done and in turn achieve greater belief in the truth of athletic performances.', 'title': 'The spirit of sport: the case for criminalisation of doping in the UK'}\n",

Data quality has been researched for decades and there are well-defined dimensions which were adopted, whereas big data characteristics represented by eleven V’s were used to characterize big data. Literature review and ten cases in financial service organizations were invested to analyze the relationship between data quality and big data. Whereas the big data characteristics and data quality have been viewed as separated domain ours findings show that these domains are intertwined and closely related. Findings from this study suggest that variety is the most dominant big data characteristic relating with most data quality dimensions, such as accuracy, objectivity, believability, understandability, interpretability, consistent representation, accessibility, ease of operations, relevance, completeness, timeliness, and value-added. Not surprisingly, the most dominant data quality dimension is value-added which relates with variety, validity, visibility, and vast resources. The most mentioned pair of big data characteristic and data quality dimension is Velocity-Timeliness.

We also examine the effect of perceived seriousness of the wrongdoing on accountants’ intention to whistleblow. We find that a financial incentive results in a higher intention to whistleblow to a relevant external authority.

The goal of authorship attribution for anonymous online messages is to identify the authorship from a group of potential suspects for investigation identification. Most previous contributions focused on extracting various writing-style features and employing machine learning algorithms to identify the author. However, as far as Chinese online messages are concerned, they contain not only Chinese characters but also English characters, special symbols, emoticons, slang, etc. It is challenging for word segmentation techniques to segment Chinese online messages correctly. Moreover, online messages are usually short. The performance for short samples would be decreased greatly using traditional machine learning algorithms. In this paper, a profile-based authorship attribution approach for Chinese online messages is firstly provided. N-gram techniques are employed to extract frequency sequences, and the category frequency feature selection method is used to filter common frequent sequences. The profile-based method is used to represent the suspects as category profiles. The illegal messages are attributed to the most likely authorship by comparing the similarity between unknown illegal online messages and suspects’ profiles. Experiments on BBS, Blog, and E-mail datasets show that the proposed profile-based authorship attribution approach can identify the authors effectively. Compared with two instance-based benchmark methods, the proposed profile-based method can obtain better authorship attribution results.', 'title': 'A Profile-Based Authorship Attribution Approach to Forensic Identification in Chinese Online Messages'}\n",

To this end, we propose a default prediction method for P2P lending combined with soft information related to textual description. We introduce a topic model to extract valuable features from the descriptive text concerning loans and construct four default prediction models to demonstrate the performance of these features for default prediction. Moreover, a two-stage method is designed to select an effective feature set containing both soft and hard information. An empirical analysis using real-word data from a major P2P lending platform in China shows that the proposed method can improve loan default prediction performance compared with existing methods based only on hard information.', 'title': 'Loan default prediction by combining soft information extracted from descriptive text in online peer-to-peer lending'}\n",

We start with a chronological overview to illustrate the growing prevalence of such attacks from their early inception 30 years ago, and identify key milestones and indicative trends which have established them as primary weapons of choice for hackers, cyber-criminals and state actors today. To demonstrate the scale and widespread nature of the threat space, we identify over 35 individually recognised types of semantic attack, existing within and cross-contaminating between a vast range of different computer platforms and user interfaces. Their extreme diversity and the little to no technical traces they leave make them particularly difficult to protect against. Technical protection systems typically focus on a single attack type on a single platform type rather than the wider landscape of deception-based attacks. To address this issue, we discuss three high-level defense approaches for preemptive and proactive protection, including adopting the semantic attack killchain concept which simplifies targeted defense; principles for preemptive and proactive protection for passive threats; and platform based defense-in-depth lifecycle designed to harness technical and non-technical defense capabilities of platform providers and their user base.

Using newspaper articles, commentaries and videos, this paper first traces the emergence of intergenerational conflicts over bus seats, along with related phenomena that have become flashpoints in the new elder-blaming discourse. Second, this paper delineates and challenges popular and academic notions that intergenerational differences in values and dispositions entirely account for intergenerational conflict. Specifically, it criticizes a notion, popular in China, that the older generations became corrupted through a series of historical misfortunes from the 1959–1961 famine onward. Aided by the tools of cross-cultural comparison, historicization, and media studies, it offers alternative explanations for intergenerational conflict, including underdeveloped infrastructure, lack of public resources, occupational pressures on the younger generations, and a decline in social trust. Third, this paper discusses why an elder-blaming discourse has been so possible to propagate. Owing to their greater illiteracy and lack of internet access, China’s older generations can rarely make their voices heard amidst sensationalist reporting that over-represents their offenses. Further, that the Chinese population is concerned with starkly increasing and profound social problems, yet is given few opportunities to comment on these problems’ structural roots, contributes to elder scapegoating.', 'title': 'The Emergence of an Elder-Blaming Discourse in Twenty-First Century China'}\n",

The genome of C. clariflavum has been sequenced to completion, and numerous cellulosomal genes were identified, including putative scaffoldin and enzyme subunits.ResultsBioinformatic analysis of the C. clariflavum genome revealed 49 cohesin modules distributed on 13 different scaffoldins and 79 dockerin-containing proteins, suggesting an abundance of putative cellulosome assemblies. The 13-scaffoldin system of C. clariflavum is highly reminiscent of the proposed cellulosome system of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus. Analysis of the C. clariflavum type I dockerin sequences indicated a very high level of conservation, wherein the putative recognition residues are remarkably similar to those of A. cellulolyticus. The numerous interactions among the cellulosomal components were elucidated using a standardized affinity ELISA-based fusion-protein system. The results revealed a rather simplistic recognition pattern of cohesin-dockerin interaction, whereby the type I and type II cohesins generally recognized the dockerins of the same type. The anticipated exception to this rule was the type I dockerin of the ScaB adaptor scaffoldin which bound selectively to the type I cohesins of ScaC and ScaJ.ConclusionsThe findings reveal an intricate picture of predicted cellulosome assemblies in C. clariflavum. The network of cohesin-dockerin pairs provides a thermophilic alternative to those of C. thermocellum and a basis for subsequent utilization of the C. clariflavum cellulosomal system for biotechnological application.', 'title': 'Cellulosomics of the cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium clariflavum'}\n",

However, a physical location is easier closed down than a virtual one. This is because the virtual forum is often situated in countries that will not cooperate with requests to take down servers. This could be considered as an advantage for the offender. But virtual forums also have specific disadvantages. Every contact and discussion is digitally preserved for those who know where to look. A law enforcement agency was able to take such a look in one particular forum. This revealed over 150,000 postings by 1,846 members. More importantly, these postings disclosed crime scripts as criminals themselves see it. It turns out that hacking accounts and stealing money is not their biggest problem. What is a risk, however, is not leaving traces when wiring the money into other accounts. This article tries to translate such insights in policy recommendations.', 'title': 'Cybercrime and virtual offender convergence settings'}\n",

Although the IoT paradigm offers numerous benefits, there are also inherent security and privacy challenges in relation to patient data. This chapter aims to investigate such security and privacy-related issues of the IoT healthcare applications that often operate on Cloud and Fog Computing architectures. In this chapter, 30 peer-reviewed publications from the years 2016 to 2018 are reviewed to construct a structured guide for the identification of related problems. Healthcare software applications, service architectures, patient data, and diverse sensory devices used are some of the factors considered for the collection of data, determination of related security and privacy issues, and implications of the said problems. Based on the factors, a comparison table is developed for analysis. Results show that most of these applications are used for remote patient care and monitoring. Furthermore, the results show that most threats occur due to unauthorized access to data, data breaches, and impersonation. Considering the IoT healthcare applications architecture (consisting of application, communication, device, network, and transport layers), we find that the device layer is the most affected layer regarding the security issues. Since most of the similar studies are limited to providing solutions regarding a specific aspect of security and privacy without considering the entire process, we have carried out additional research for a holistic approach to solve the bigger problem. We suggest that application developers should pay particular attention to these threats when designing IoT healthcare applications to provide secure and efficient applications to enhance the services within the healthcare sector. This study could be helpful to plan mitigation methodologies to conquer the inherent vulnerabilities in the IoT healthcare applications.', 'title': 'Internet of Things in the Healthcare Sector: Overview of Security and Privacy Issues'}\n",

In the study outlined below, participants were plagued by a variety of barriers ranging from lack of power to lack of trained technical personnel. In a report on improving geospatial support for disaster management the National Research Council identified several critical barriers to successful response to emergencies: a combination of lack of adequately trained staff and technically complicated geospatial software tools, lack of agreement and means for successful data distribution, and data “format[s] which are unrecognizable or unusable [for] responding agencies (NRC, 2007: 157).” A collection of researchers, open source software projects and companies has been developing technology to advance the delivery of geospatial and data sharing capabilities to non-technical users in ad-hoc environments.

To assess this cultural pulse, it is critical to have an accurate assessment of who is saying what. Unfortunately, social media is also the home of users who engage in disruptive, disingenuous, and potentially illegal activity. A range of users, both human and non-human, carry out such social cyber-attacks. We ask, to what extent does the presence or absence of such users influence our ability to assess the cultural pulse of a region? Our prior research on this topic showed that Twitter-based network structures and content are unstable and can be highly impacted by the removal of suspended users. Because of this, statistical techniques can be established to differentiate potential types of suspended and non-suspended users. In this extended paper, we develop additional experiments to explore the spatial patterns of suspended users, and we further consider how these users affect structural and content concentrations via the development of new metrics and new analyses. We find significant evidence that suspended users exist on the periphery of social networks on Twitter and consequently that removing them has little impact on network structure. We also improve prior attempts to distinguish among different types of suspended users by using a much larger dataset. Finally, we conduct a temporal sentiment analysis to illustrate differences between suspended users and non-suspended users on this dimension.', 'title': 'Exploring characteristics of suspended users and network stability on Twitter'}\n",

To promote understanding of the complexity and interconnection of corrupt activities, we aim to present healthcare-related corruption typologies of the European Union and European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network. We subsequently link them to the typology of individual and institutional corruption introduced by Dennis Thompson in the context of investigating misconduct of US Congressional members. According to Thompson, individual corruption is the personal gain of individuals performing duties within an institution in exchange for nurturing private interests, while institutional corruption pertains to the failure of the institution in directing the individual’s behaviour towards the achievement of the institution’s primary purpose because the institutional design promotes the pursuit of individual goals. Effective anti-corruption activities not only require the enactment of anti-corruption laws but also the monitoring and, where appropriate, revision of institutional frameworks to prevent the undermining of the primary purposes of health systems or institutions. To gain further understanding of the similarities and differences of the three typologies, prime examples of corrupt activities in the health sector in the European Union and USA (along with their potential remedies) are provided. Linking corruption cases to Thompson’s typology revealed that many corrupt activities may show elements of both individual and institutional corruption because they are intertwined, partly overlap and may occur jointly.

Distinct regional variations, such as high rates in the western and southwestern states, and low rates in New England and the central plains states, are identified for identity theft. Significant spatial patterns of identity theft victims alongside social demographic variables are also revealed in order to better understand the regional patterns that may suggest underlying social causes contributing to identity theft.

Both historical and current process execution data can be used to compose such conditions. At run-time, each sensor independently notifies a sensor manager when a risk is detected. In turn, the sensor manager interacts with the monitoring component of a process automation suite to prompt the results to the user who may take remedial actions.
